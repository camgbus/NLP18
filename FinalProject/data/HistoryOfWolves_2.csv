HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
This is a rites of passage type book, a young person dealing with and learning about life
Madeline, Linda, Mattie is fourteen in eighth grade, living in the North Woods in northern Minnesota
She is not popular with her peers,lives in a small rundown house close to a lake
Her parents were members of a commune when she was born
The commune broke apart several years ago, Linda's best friend left with her parents
The only ones to stay is Madeline and her mom and dad
Linda is an only child
The author seems to like the number eleven
Paul is four, Linda, fifteen,Mom, Patra is twenty-six, Dad, Leo is thirty-seven
The story is told by Linda until the time she is thirty-seven
The book drifts between times, but stays mostly in times when Mattie is 14/15
The girls mind goes back in forth in time,younger and older
The North Woods is gorgeous and Mattie knows all parts of the area where she lives
Mr Fridlunds's writing is beautiful about the natural world, and seems to know the feelings of a young girl growing up and having to deal with mean girls
Linda lives about five miles from the small town and sees very few people, her parents being among them
Then across the lake a summer home is being built
Into her life comes four year old Paul and Patra, his mom
Father is an astronomy professor, working in Hawaii
Patra hires Linda as a governess for her son, a young person to keep the boy occupied while she does some writing for her husband's science projects
Madeline becomes close with this family, possibly too close
She seems to want to stay when Leo wants her to leave the three to enjoy each other
Or do they? Patra seems too young and immature to be a mom, Leo too domineering
Madeline writes to her former eighth grade teacher, Mr Grierson, over the years
The two keep in touch
Mr Grierson, coming from California, asked Mattie to do something about local history
"She chose to write ""The History of Wolves"""
This book won several awards, this is why I chose to read it
Teen age Linda is so much like girls her age
Bored, depressed, wanting more from life than she is getting in this time and place
Mr Grierson is the only person Linda has kept in touch with over the years
She is thirty-seven when her story ends
At age thirty-seven, Madeline is still just drifting through life
When Maddie was a child and a teenager, her parents, especially her mother, seemed to want to be close to their daughter, but didn't know how to be warm and tender
