ExitWest	Mohsin Hamid
In terms of the physical book it's in great shape as it arrived! 	Rev
In terms of the author and the words and everything that should be in a book, it's definitely different	WS
It's written in the 3rd person rather than through Saeed or Nadia, which is incredibly hard for authors to write in, but Hamid has done so pretty well	WS
It's a very descriptive book that at least I feel has some pointless elements to it, but I'll leave it to future readers to find those	WS
It's one of those books that you kind of don't love, but can't put down	Rev
So, BUY IT!	Rev
