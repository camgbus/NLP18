Elmet	Fiona Mozley
Elmet is a timeless story of class in rural England
It could have happened one hundred or more years ago
It is happening now in the Yorkshire village of Elmet
A man who owns the land, countless acres of forest, decides the lives of the poor who need a place to live and to scrape out a living
Daniel, a fourteen-year-old boy, narrates his family's painful saga
Daniel lives with his father and his sister
They once lived with his grandmother, but the kids bullied Daniel and Cathy
John, the father, took them out of school and moved far away to a forest
John and his children carved out space in the forest and eventually built a house, made entirely from their hands
They lived off of hunting, foraging and a small garden that Daniel kept
John took Daniel and Cathy to a friend's house in the mornings for a bit of tutoring
It was a haphazard approach to education
Daniel became close to Vivienne and loved his mornings with her, talking about all the things in the world he had never seen
Daniel's knowledge of the world was limited to his memories of his mother, his grandmother's house, and the fantastic stories Vivienne told about world events
The children were innocent in the ways of the world, entirely dependent on their father's brawn to provide for them and the loving closeness of their family to nurture their souls
John Price, the wealthy landowner, intrudes in their quiet life and turns it upside down
It is at the hands of the greedy Price and his sons that the poor people of the area, particularly John and his children, suffer because they have no choice in life but to work with the very little they have
Price has no sympathy for the underemployed men who live as his tenants
The hired henchmen collect the rent or throw the tenants into the street
The saga comes to a head when Price accuses John of a crime he did not commit
Elmet offers an intimate and painful knowledge of life in the rural north that hasn't changed much in hundreds of years
It is a microcosm of the suffering going on there and in other places in the world today
Fiona Mozley writes with authority and a genuine feel for this family and many like them
I was happy to read this novel, one I will not quickly forget
