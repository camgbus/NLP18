15-year-old Cathy and 13-year-old Daniel have been living with their grandmother but when she dies, their father moves them to a land to which their family has some ties and builds a home for them there
Their father, John, is a huge, strong man who sometimes will enter into a prize fight to earn some money
He once worked as an enforcer for Mr
Price, the evil landlord of the story
While there’s a violent side to John, there also is a very gentle one
Their secluded life is fractured when Price starts questioning their right to remain on this land
I’m feeling very conflicted about how I feel about this book
So many parts of it are 5 stars for me
And yet I’m left with too much confusion
I usually don’t mind a book that doesn’t tie up all the loose ends
But this one just leaves me with far too many questions
It’s almost skeletal in nature, the bare bones of the story
And yet I couldn’t tear myself away, compulsively wanting to know more
I think I would like to re-read this book in time but read it with the knowledge that it’s partly a surreal fairy tale
I think my first reading had too much of a realistic outlook and that’s why I was left hung up on many of the details
It’s gorgeously written, intensely suspenseful and very moving
Shortlisted for the 2017 Man Booker Prize
