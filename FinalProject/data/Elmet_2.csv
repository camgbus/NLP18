I’m feeling very conflicted about how I feel about this book	Rev
So many parts of it are 5 stars for me	Rev
And yet I’m left with too much confusion	Rev
I usually don’t mind a book that doesn’t tie up all the loose ends	Rev
But this one just leaves me with far too many questions	Rev
It’s almost skeletal in nature, the bare bones of the story	Sto
And yet I couldn’t tear myself away, compulsively wanting to know more	Rev
I think I would like to re-read this book in time but read it with the knowledge that it’s partly a surreal fairy tale	Rev
I think my first reading had too much of a realistic outlook and that’s why I was left hung up on many of the details	Rev
It’s gorgeously written, intensely suspenseful and very moving	WS
Shortlisted for the 2017 Man Booker Prize	O
