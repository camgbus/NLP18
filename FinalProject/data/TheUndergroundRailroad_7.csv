This is an excellent insight into the life of American slaves torn from their lives in Africa
They were treated terribly from the start
The groups were mixed so that when on the ship, they could not speak with each other because of language differences
Many tried to jump overboard, but were stopped and chained to the ship
Many Africans were brought to this country as slaves because the South was in need of great numbers of workers for the cotton crop
The book goes on about the horrible life they led including rape by the white men who were supervisors
Some escaped and had to find a way to live which was difficult
The book is excellent and I think should be read by all
