TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
The story and writing got to my bones	WS
I could not put the book down	Rev
It has so many layers of meaning that I will probably read it again	Rev
This novel tells the history of our country (including contemporary debates about race and immigration) with so much sensitivity and nuance that it prompted me to think a lot about my own place in the historical trajectory that Whitehead charts	Sum
And I felt Cora's breath and saw her eyes in the pages	Rev
My stomach cringed so many times as I mentally followed her underground or imagined her cramped in the attic of a white couple in North Carolina whose fear and inability to engage with the reality served to them prevented them from taking responsibility even for their own lives	Rev
And I felt pressure in my chest only to realize that I was holding my breath as I read (often impatiently) to see if Cora's strength would enable her to survive and also shield her humanity	Rev
I truly hope that many people read this novel	Rev
