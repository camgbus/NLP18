SwingTime	Zadie Smith
Smith's characters are loveable in their imperfection
Two young girls share a love of dance and music but diverge in their experiences with the world
The author's commentary on fame, global citizenship, and the complexities of race are provocative and compelling
This would be a perfect selection for a book club to discuss, ponder and dissect
Some of Smith's narrative is pure poetry and it is aimed directly at the heart
