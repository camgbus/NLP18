ExitWest	Mohsin Hamid
This is the story of two well defined characters who experience many trials as they immigrate from their war torn homes in an unnamed country
While it is beautifully written I didn't favor the somewhat sci-fi aspect of the story
However, the author keep me involved enough that I wanted to see what ultimately happened to them
A satisfying ending
