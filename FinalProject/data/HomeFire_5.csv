HomeFire	Kamila Shamsie
Isma Pasha has moved to the United States from her home in England to teach
She has raised her twin siblings Aneeka and Parvais in Wembly, outside of London, among the Muslim community there
Both are 19 yrs old
They are all children of a jihadi fighter and, therefore, are carefully watched by the authorities
Parvais has left the country to join ISIS
Isma, in the meantime, befriends Eamonn, son of the British Home Secretary and shows him a photo of her sister
Eamonn is immediately taken and agrees to send her some candy
He winds up delivering it himself and after meeting Aneeka they become enamored with each other
When Parveis communicates his desire to return, this sets off an increasingly complex set of circumstances that winds its way to inevitable tragedy while examining family loyalties, religious affiliations and the true meaning of love
HOME FIRE is a compelling narrative
There is a desperation and realism in the relationship between Aneeka and Eamonn
The characters are complex with no stereotypes present
What keeps the pages turning is the uncertainty of what keeps Aneeka and Eamonn together and how they will deal with Parvaisâ€™ wish to come home given that Eamonn is the son of a major political figure in Great Britain
It is a clever plot and in the end, Kamila Shamsie pulls off an unforgettable twist
