LincolnInTheBardo	George Saunders
I was expecting a lot from this book and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed
It's clear to me that I can't fully appreciate Mr
Saunders alternative writing and since the onset I had a complicated relationship with this book (there were sections where I felt completely lost) I tried my hardest to like it, I really did
I know a few people who has swooned over this book
Not me
There is a very good chance that my aversion betrays a complete lack of understanding on my part
But in all honesty, I can't recommend it to anyone
