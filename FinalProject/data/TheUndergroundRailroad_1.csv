TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
If all Colson Whitehead’s remarkable The Underground Railroad had to offer was its central conceit – in which the “Underground Railroad,” a covert, loose organization that worked to help slaves in the Confederacy get to freedom, becomes a literal subterranean rail network – that might almost be enough to capture the imagination and make the book great	Sto
Because, in short, what this allows Whitehead to do is tell an age-old story – the efforts of a runaway slave to escape – in a way that feels like little else out there, bringing new life to a story that none of us can ever afford to forget	Sto
It’s a minor tweak to reality, but it gives the story a unique, odd feel, making literal the astonishing work that went into saving these people	Sto
So, yeah, that might be enough	Rev
But luckily for us all, Whitehead has more on his mind than just that one conceit	Rev
Instead, Whitehead turns this flight for freedom into a modern day Odyssey, letting each stop along the way become an entirely different narrative in the life of slavery, America’s race relations, prejudice, and fear	Sto
And the result is a sprawling, strange, haunting novel, one whose separate episodes combine to make something far more fascinating and complex than any one story might have been able to do on its own	Sto
For instance, a more traditional slave escape narrative could never contain the subtly wrong paradise that feels at first like heaven on Earth, only to have Whitehead slowly turn that world on its head	Sto
You wouldn’t have the nightmarishly violent community that has purged itself of African-Americans in the most horrific way possible; nor would you have the beauty of acts of kindness that come when least expected	Sum
In Whitehead’s capable hands, the journey becomes a more complex one, echoing back and forth through time as he takes on racism not just as an explicit force of slavery, but as a much more insidious, subtle evil that can hide behind people’s smiles	Sto
In other words, it’s not just the slave catchers we need to fear; it’s those for whom help means condescension and manipulation	Sto
Make no mistake, though; this is undeniably a book about slavery, and one that deals with the horrors of the institution without blinking or flinching	Sto
Violence is casual and brutal, with torture being commonplace and almost barely worthy of mention	Sto
And while our heroine’s plantation is known for its cruelty, that doesn’t mean that it’s any more cruel than half of what she sees in her journeys	Sum
Whitehead doesn’t allow us the luxury of “this place is the worst”; it’s just a particularly bad one, but nothing special	Sum
And even if it were somehow worse, it barely compares to some of the psychological and emotional horrors to come, and the wanton cruelty and disregard that we see on display throughout the book	Sto
And yet, for all of that, The Underground Railroad is still a slave escape narrative, one in which we’re invested in our heroine’s success, and one that keeps us reading in the face of all of the potential horrors, hoping for something good	Sto
Whitehead never lets The Underground Railroad become crushing or so bleak as to be unpalatable; he tempers it, mixing the good and the bad, and investing us in the characters so that we need them to succeed – and feel it all the more when some of them don’t	Char
In other words, The Underground Railroad is something remarkable – a look at history that finds its truth through fiction, a dose of magical realism that serves to emphasize hard facts, a novel that explores ideas that many of us wish we had left in history	Sto
That it does all this is no small feat; that it does so in such a complex, powerful way without ever becoming didactic or simplistic, even less of one	WS
But the fact that it manages to do all of that while still telling a gripping, exciting story?	WS
That‘s what makes it such an incredible novel, and worthy of its reputation	Rev
