Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
In Reservoir 13, like all of McGregor's novels, nothing happens and yet everything happens
Life happens in other words, which is this author's area of interest and it’s what he is able to capture so uniquely and brilliantly in his writing
Reservoir 13 follows the rhythms of life that are barely discernible to the individual caught up in their own circumstances, unable to determine what is trivial and what is important in the bigger picture
McGregor's writing might seem to be focuses on the mundane, but there is always a sense of the bigger picture in there
Reservoir 13 opens a little deceptively with a big news event; the disappearance/abduction of a 13 year old girl, Rebecca Shaw, from a rural community in middle England
A decade or more passes and people vaguely reflect that something terrible once happened there, but they only half-remember the girl's name and get on with their lives
That's basically the rhythm that Reservoir 13 falls into and it's one that is a bit like most people's lives
It might seem like it fizzles out and nothing ever lives up to the 'main event', but the disappearance of Rebecca Shaw leaves behind repercussions that might seem unrelated, but are significant nonetheless for the people involved
Anyone who isn't familiar with the author's distinctive style could find Reservoir 13 rather mundane and wonder why nothing actually happens
It's a very unconventional style of writing that isn’t so much interested in narrative as much as rhythm
It's this pattern, this overview, that impression that Jon McGregor's writing aims to capture and, for better or worse, he does it remarkably well
On the other hand you could see it as indeed nothing but narrative, with no great insight or psychological underpinning, merely a series of small moments of no great significance
It’s everything and it’s nothing
If anything McGregor’s writing technique has become even more refined and simplified as he reaches his fourth novel
There are fewer points of revelation there for impact, fewer poetic observations and less emotional resonance that you might have found in If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things or So Many Ways to Begin
And if the misery of the lives of down-and-outs in Even the Dogs was almost unendurable, Reservoir 13 seems to strive for a more detached observation on life while still encompassing all of it and still striving for a deeper truth
It’s not going to win any new fans and it will test those who were attracted to his earlier writing, but in Reservoir 13 Jon McGregor seem to be determined to follow his own narrative voice on a path where he still has few equals
