ExitWest	Mohsin Hamid
A very timely novel
Who says that magic realism is dead? I loved the the first part better than the second, but I see where Hamid wanted to arrive
I'm writing from Italy where we are in the midst of the migrants' crisis
I hope the Italian translation is in the works if not on the shelves already
