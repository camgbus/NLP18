This book is a bit different as well	WS
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this as it has beautiful narrative	Rev
The book flows with the character’s thoughts as you go from one thought to the next without stopping	WS
This book is written in line breaks and one LONG sentence	WS
I feel it was necessary for the story as it gave it more oomph	Rev
While reading the synopsis of the book I thought this would be a tad different than what I ended up reading	Rev
However what I did read was different for all the right reasons as I was drawn into the character’s mind as I saw into his life and who he is/was as a person	Char
As I came to the conclusion of this book I was glad I went into this book blind as I’ve noticed tons of spoilers out there	Rev
If you pay close enough attention to the blurb for this book you are given away the ending (which still shook me)	Rev
After reading author interviews I learned this book goes so much deeper than I thought	Rev
The author had actually mentioned he wanted to give away the ending due him not wanting it to feel cheap	Sto
While I love huge surprise endings as such, I can see how it did benefit the book to have given away such	Rev
The writing style is commendable and I could not tear myself from this book	WS
There is such a poeticness to the voice behind this book	WS
The premise of this book kept me reading on	Sto
The way the book flows was absolutely beautiful and I loved every word of it	WS
This should have gotten a lot more notice I believe but I think the issue was the writing style	WS
So, again take this book for what it is and go into it blind and let it flow though you and see the deeper meanings	Rev
Truly an author to keep on your shelf	Rev
5 stars from me	Rev
I received this book from SoHo Teen in exchange for my open and honest review	Rev
