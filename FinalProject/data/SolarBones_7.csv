SO…
This book is a bit different as well
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this as it has beautiful narrative
The book flows with the character’s thoughts as you go from one thought to the next without stopping
This book is written in line breaks and one LONG sentence
I feel it was necessary for the story as it gave it more oomph
While reading the synopsis of the book I thought this would be a tad different than what I ended up reading
However what I did read was different for all the right reasons as I was drawn into the character’s mind as I saw into his life and who he is/was as a person
As I came to the conclusion of this book I was glad I went into this book blind as I’ve noticed tons of spoilers out there
If you pay close enough attention to the blurb for this book you are given away the ending (which still shook me)
After reading author interviews I learned this book goes so much deeper than I thought
The author had actually mentioned he wanted to give away the ending due him not wanting it to feel cheap
While I love huge surprise endings as such, I can see how it did benefit the book to have given away such
The writing style is commendable and I could not tear myself from this book
There is such a poeticness to the voice behind this book
The premise of this book kept me reading on
The way the book flows was absolutely beautiful and I loved every word of it
This should have gotten a lot more notice I believe but I think the issue was the writing style
So, again take this book for what it is and go into it blind and let it flow though you and see the deeper meanings
Truly an author to keep on your shelf
5 stars from me
I received this book from SoHo Teen in exchange for my open and honest review
