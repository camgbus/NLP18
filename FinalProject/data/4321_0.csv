4321	Paul Auster	
Let's establish right away that Paul Auster is one of my favorite authors	Reviewer	
"In fact, I'd consider myself something of a ""fanboy"	Reviewer	
I've read the vast majority of his published work after discovering him about ten years ago	Reviewer	
He earned my trust back then, which means I will read anything he releases	Reviewer	
4321 is an ambitious work that absolutely experiments with style and execution	Writing Style	
It is extremely well written, meticulously organized, and clearly a labor of love	Writing Style	
This is an important novel due to its sheer moxie; it not only challenges well-established conventions in the field of literature, it summarily ignores them	Writing Style	Story
But, even with all of that being said, it missed the mark for me	Reviewer	
At 866 pages, 4321 proved too much for this reader	Writing Style	
As you know, Auster is an avid baseball fan, and I definitely felt like I needed a scorecard for this epic volume	Reviewer	Author
Without spoiling too much, this novel imagines the four possible lives of a single man	Summary	
We follow him from boyhood all the way to death	Summary	
There are many touchstones that are obviously invariable from life to life, but there are also several deviations that alter one life drastically from another	Summary	Story
It's a fascinating premise, one that we've all thought about from time to time	Story	
What if my parents had separated? What if I'd chosen a different school? What if I had fallen into that pit and been paralyzed? So many what ifs in life 	Story	Other
Auster delves deeply into this notion while leaving no detail unexplored	Writing Style	Story
But, like Annie Proulx's Barkskins, those nuanced details can overwhelm the reader to the point of provoking disengagement	Writing Style	
At least, that's what happened in my case	Reviewer	
Furthermore, if I'm being honest, Ferguson (the main character) is not especially interesting	Characterization	
No matter which life we address, Ferguson is a bit aloof, a bit too precocious, a bit unlikable	Characterization	
"Well, perhaps ""unlikable"" is too strong of a word"	Characterization	
"I would never describe him as ""likable,"" though"	Characterization	
"Keep in mind, I don't believe a character has to be ""good"" in the moral sense to be ""likable"	Reviewer	
"There have been plenty of bad"" characters that I thought were incredibly charismatic"	Reviewer	
On the subject of morality, be warned 	Story	
there is a lot of sex in this book -- more than any Paul Auster book I've ever read	Story	
There is straight sex, gay sex, committed sex, casual sex, oral sex, anal sex 	Story	
you get the idea	Other	
The sex often seemed to me as forced	Story	Writing Style
It never quite struck me as organic to the story	Story	Writing Style
While I found this to be a relevant addition to the author's library because it broke new ground for an already inventive artist, it did not hold my attention	Author	
While the writing is masterful, it failed to capture my imagination	Writing Style	
And while the characters are pounding with life, none of them seemed to take hold in my own	Characterization
