4321	Paul Auster
Let's establish right away that Paul Auster is one of my favorite authors	Rev
"In fact, I'd consider myself something of a ""fanboy"	Rev
I've read the vast majority of his published work after discovering him about ten years ago	Rev
He earned my trust back then, which means I will read anything he releases	Rev
4321 is an ambitious work that absolutely experiments with style and execution	WS
It is extremely well written, meticulously organized, and clearly a labor of love	WS
This is an important novel due to its sheer moxie; it not only challenges well-established conventions in the field of literature, it summarily ignores them	WS
But, even with all of that being said, it missed the mark for me	Rev
At 866 pages, 4321 proved too much for this reader	Rev
As you know, Auster is an avid baseball fan, and I definitely felt like I needed a scorecard for this epic volume	Rev
Without spoiling too much, this novel imagines the four possible lives of a single man	Sum
We follow him from boyhood all the way to death	Sum
There are many touchstones that are obviously invariable from life to life, but there are also several deviations that alter one life drastically from another	Sum
It's a fascinating premise, one that we've all thought about from time to time	Sto
What if my parents had separated?	Sto
What if I'd chosen a different school?	Sto
What if I had fallen into that pit and been paralyzed?	Sto
So many what ifs in life 	Sto
Auster delves deeply into this notion while leaving no detail unexplored	Sto
But, like Annie Proulx's Barkskins, those nuanced details can overwhelm the reader to the point of provoking disengagement	WS
At least, that's what happened in my case	Rev
Furthermore, if I'm being honest, Ferguson (the main character) is not especially interesting	Char
No matter which life we address, Ferguson is a bit aloof, a bit too precocious, a bit unlikable	Char
"Well, perhaps ""unlikable"" is too strong of a word"	Char
"I would never describe him as ""likable,"" though"	Char
"Keep in mind, I don't believe a character has to be ""good"" in the moral sense to be ""likable"	Char
"There have been plenty of bad"" characters that I thought were incredibly charismatic"	Char
On the subject of morality, be warned 	Sto
there is a lot of sex in this book -- more than any Paul Auster book I've ever read	Sto
There is straight sex, gay sex, committed sex, casual sex, oral sex, anal sex 	Sto
you get the idea	O
The sex often seemed to me as forced	Rev
It never quite struck me as organic to the story	Rev
While I found this to be a relevant addition to the author's library because it broke new ground for an already inventive artist, it did not hold my attention	Rev
While the writing is masterful, it failed to capture my imagination	WS
And while the characters are pounding with life, none of them seemed to take hold in my own	Char
