LincolnInTheBardo	George Saunders
George Saunders' first novel lives up to his reputation for eccentric melding of genres and forms	WS
Lincoln may be in the title (which Lincoln is meant is another matter), but the book is as much about its other, fictional narrators as it is about historical figures	Char
What other narrators?	Char
Well	Rev
Abraham Lincoln's third son died of typhoid fever in early 1862, and for a time the president's concentration was broken while the Civil War raged	Sum
Newspapers reported that he returned to the crypt by night to hold his son's body	Sum
And in George Saunders' novel, those visits were observed	Sum
Not by the living, but by the dead	Sum
The bulk of the book is their monologues and dialogues, as they explain their lives, their deaths, the reasons they didn't move on from the world	Sum
Their voices are lively, and at their best they capture that great postmodern subject, the mingled beauty and horror of the world, but I'm not sure the fractured approach has the impact it wants to achieve	Char
The very sprawl of Saunders' imagination reduces many characters to vignettes	Char
There's a balance between scope and immediacy that I'm not sure is optimally achieved	WS
And yet: the voices	Char
Intellectual, pompous, profane, mournful	Char
Having finished the novel, I want them back	Rev
The plot, such as it is, involves Willie Lincoln's lingering spirit, and the danger it faces	Sum
Child ghosts are soon warped by a mysterious metaphysics into monstrous creatures	Sum
The narrators want to protect Willie from that, and to use his father's visit to convince him to move on	Sum
But their own afterlives may be fundamentally changed by that effort	Sum
The climactic sequence toward which all this builds is a thing of beauty, getting the balance between the big and the little right in a way the rest of the novel may not	Sto
The thematic matter of the novel is, as I've suggested, the usual attempt to grapple with the senselessness of life	Sto
"As ever, the trouble with it is that there's no answer except ""I can't go on, I'll go on"	Sto
But Saunders is better than many writers at avoiding platitudes and confronting readers with the darker side of life without creating the feeling that he just wants to make you wallow in it	WS
He gets, for example, at the irony of Lincoln's grief: that a man should be distracted by his own mourning from a war in which he will make hundreds of thousands of other parents into mourners	Sto
This is a striking case-in-point for the ways in which we navigate the ironies of our uncertain existence	Sto
Star ratings are arbitrary, and in this case I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars	Rev
Yes, I can say 4 5, but it's not what will show up on the review	Rev
I like a novel with clean lines, and Lincoln in the Bardo is not that: its collision of ideas, and its brevity, is what you'd expect from a short story writer grappling with a form for which he may not be suited	WS
I haven't even mentioned the chapters that mix real historical texts with fictional ones to create accounts that have the poetry of fiction and the authenticity of non-fiction	WS
They're gorgeous, but they're also oddly integrated into the larger narrative structure	WS
Should that matter?	O
Some would say no, and intellectually I think they're right	Rev
Life is messy, why should art be different?	O
But I'm a neat freak in every way, and I like symmetry	Rev
4 stars, 5 stars, so what? 	Rev
The numbers are only there because Amazon requires them	O
This is a book you should read if you like Saunders, or other writers in his playful, off-kilter vein, names like Kelly Link, Aimee Bender, and Karen Russell	Rev
Readers of more straightforward books will think it's just willfully peculiar	Rev
You're not wrong, but you're missing out	Rev
