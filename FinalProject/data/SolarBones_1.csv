SolarBones	Mike McCormack
First off, don't read the blurb on the back cover of this book, or the description above! In its third line, it gives away something that Mike McCormack takes 200 pages to reveal, something that I see as the main point of the entire novel
** Instead, open at the first page and let McCormack's poetic language work on you: the bell the bell as hearing the bell as hearing the bell as standing here the bell being heard standing here hearing it ring out through the grey light of this morning, noon or night god knows this grey day standing here and listening to this bell in the middle of the day, the middle of the day bell, the Angelus bell in the middle of the day, ringing out through the grey light to here standing in the kitchen hearing this bell snag my heart and draw the whole world into being here It does not stop
Indeed, there is not a single period in the entire novel
"I found it a mesmerizing beginning, with a rhythm that teases the ear, an echo of Joyce, the end of ""The Dead"" or Molly Bloom, fused with something that is all his own, something incantatory, magnificent, in its repetitions of short phrases: the village of Louisburgh from which the Angelus bell is ringing, drawing up the world again mountains, rivers and lakes acres, roots, and perches animal, mineral, vegetable covenant, cross and crown the given world with all its history to brace myself while standing here in the kitchen of this house I was about to put this book on my poetry shelf, and still might"
However, while this is a poet's language to which McCormack will return, very soon he will get into prose
Very dense prose sometimes, with paragraphs taking up an entire page, without break or major punctuation
It requires a special kind of reading: to let it all flow through you, picking up the images and feelings, but ignoring the details
I did not enjoy this, for I kept wanting to pause, to understand, to put things into some logical sequence, but was frustrated
Only in the last fifty pages or so did I find a rhythm that kept me moving forward yet gave me the details too
And very beautiful details they were; McCormack is a fine writer
Once I finally got into gear, I felt my first strong attachment to the character, and was gripped by the suspense of what would become of him
The end, especially, was quite moving, and finally explained the style in which the novel is written throughout
The man in the kitchen is Marcus Conway, a civil engineer working for the county authorities in Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland
He lives with his wife Mairead, who is recuperating from a serious illness
Agnes, their eldest child, is an artist in Galway City nearby; their son Darragh is working in the Australian outback as part of a round-the-world trip to find himself
Marcus ranges far and wide in his memories, taking in local politics, global economics, and modernization
He remembers his father, also an engineer
He recalls the early years of his marriage, and its near collapse
He thinks of his time in the seminary, and how he gave up one creed for another, as intense as a religion itself
Like Christ in the wilderness, he meets temptation, and does not give in
All jumbled up
While there seems a kind of hindsight logic to it now, there was a long period when I had no idea what the author's point was, or where he was headed
Towards the end, however, Marcus's thoughts concentrate on a period of about ten days leading up to the present moment
And as they do the book's focus begins to narrow
It is a novel about a family, and more particularly about a marriage, a long and ultimately very happy marriage
Once I realized that, I could stop reading for the originality of language alone, and fully empathize
If only the blurb hadn't told me what was coming
** ====== ** Reading other reviews and the comments attached to them, I have been pointed to an interview in which the author indicates that he actually wanted the reader to know what the blurb gives away
That does not necessarily make it right
It gave me one kind of reading experience, but I still feel that the other would have been stronger
Besides, an author is responsible for what is between the covers; relying on what is printed on the jacket just seems a weak play, abdicating responsibility for something that he could have made clearer in his own words if he wanted to
