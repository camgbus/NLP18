Daniel, a young boy, lives with his sister, Cathy and their Daddy
They live in a house Daddy built with his own hands meant to last a very long time
Their house is remote and, as a result, Cathy and Daniel do not attend school with other children their age
Daddy occasionally disappears to fight which is how he makes his money
Daddy tries to make for them a safe and secure home
The land they live on, however, belongs to someone else- Mr Price, who seeks payment in some way
It is a way that will eventually lead to violence
There is so much to this story
In a sense, it is a coming of age tale
It examines the nature of relationships and how well we know somebody- even if they are in our family
Most impressive, in this debut novel, is the way the author not only establishes realistic characters but how she ratchets up the suspense little by little until the explosive ending
It is brilliant work and with a unique voice
This novel was also longlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2017
For an unknown author and a small press book, it is a remarkable achievement
