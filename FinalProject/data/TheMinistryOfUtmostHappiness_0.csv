I expected to love this book	Rev
I loved “God of Small Things” and several of my all-time favourite books are by Indian authors	Rev
So after approaching it full of anticipation and expectations, it pains me to say that I found it almost unreadable	Rev
Which is feel sure is more about me and my failure as a literary reader	Rev
But I did not “get” it	Rev
The book is about a disjointed trio on the margins of society, people who have no people, who come together and make a new home in a Delhi graveyard	Sto
Anjum is a hermaphrodite who considers herself a “counterfeit woman” and who longs to be a mother	Sum
Saddam Hussein hero-worships the dictator Saddam Hussein and has renamed himself in his honor	Sum
And Tilo’s great love is a Kashmiri terrorist	Sum
It’s an extremely disjointed novel, more like a collection of barely related stories that move backwards and forwards in time, which gradually weave themselves together to allow you to spot the common threads	WS
Along the way we are introduced to dozens of characters and for almost every one we will be given their back story in detail, whether it is relevant or not	Char
There is a lot of telling us “what happened” and not a lot of dialogue	WS
Essentially this is a book without a plot and if you realise that going in, you’ll probably struggle less with it than I did	Rev
The writing is lovely: scenes are described in such a way that you’re there, you see what the characters are seeing	WS
Even characters who make only a brief appearance are brought vividly to life	Char
The instability in Kashmir and its effect on the people who live there is chillingly portrayed – when an ear infection means you could get shot because you can’t hear the instructions from the checkpoints	Sto
I finished it and I feel a sense of accomplishment for doing so, but would I recommend it?	Rev
No not really	Rev
