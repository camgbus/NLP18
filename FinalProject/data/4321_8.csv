4321	Paul Auster
This was my first Paul Auster book and one of the first I'd read after a long break from casual reading	Rev
At almost 900 pages, it kept me engaged nearly the whole time with a story that resonates with me (nearing 24 years in age) as it covers young Ferguson's journey through adolescence and into the uncertainty of young adulthood	Rev
The structure of the four stories in parallel was tough to get used to at first, but the core of Archie Ferguson is strong enough once you have fully processed it to devote more attention to the side characters and stories that develop to differentiate each storyline	Char
Some of the historical elements were fascinating for me to read through, even if the pace could be a bit tedious	WS
Contrary to what I expected of myself, I enjoyed some of Auster's full-page run-on sentences as he spoke in stream-of-consciousness to reflect the focus of various characters on different topics	Rev
I'm happy to have read this book, as I believe it to be a challenging and rewarding read	Rev
