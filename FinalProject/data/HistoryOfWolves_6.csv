HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
Emily Fridlund created one of my favorite types of stories to read
She included Linda as an an astounding unreliable yet intelligent and truly almost omnipotent narrator as the characters‘ s details and motives are revealed 
Each character is a deep study into the complicated relationships that grow between people in their small unique family units in relation to other family units and their core beliefs in relation to society as a whole
Just as wolves in their unique hierarchy and arrangements in natural order of their own tribes or pacts, people can be just as vicious as they strive for survival
But, don’t let this fool you
Inside this story there are mysteries and questions about life and the nature of individuals that come out in experiences in this novel that we all long to learn more about
There are often thin lines between good and evil, truth and lies, who is right in their beliefs about God and Religion, when is it right to take a life or when is it right to let one go, when is it murder and when is it an unknowing accident ? This small wonder of a novel is packed with beautifully written passages of prose descriptions that run wildly like poetry in the woods, snow, and the icy wilderness of Minnesota
This tells you in general what I loved about this book and what I find appealing in most exceptional reading
I read between the lines a bit to trust this author
She did not spell out the general plot
Linda is a young teen growing up with her parents in a cabin left over from an old commune her parents began and the charter group separated 
They live deep in the woods on one of the lakes of Minnesota
The town itself is about 7 miles away
Suddenly, a family moves into a quaint cottage across the lake from Linda’s family
This is when loneliness and curiosity take their natural course and strange things begin to happen that change Linda forever 
Mystery, murder, mayhem, natural instinct to survive are only a few deeply concerning topics
Let’s just say Linda is one special “Lone Wolf”! I recommend this superior read to everyone who loves to question and learn in this world especially when the answers are not always easily found or may just be pondered for life
