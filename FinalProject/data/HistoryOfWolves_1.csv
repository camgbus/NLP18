HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
Good writing offers, among other things, a faithful depiction of external reality
In great writing, there is an additional focus is on the experience of that reality--from the author's (or the protagonist's) point of view--and this must be done in a way that is both artful and subtle, so it resonates with the reader without overwhelming detail or pretension
This is exactly what characterizes Emily Fridlund's writing in this complex -- yet very readable-- novel
"Here is a sampling: ""After another half hour, clouds hunkered down over the treetops, and a breeze nicked the lake's surface, giving it the look of old skin"
I beached the canoe, and shunted it discreetly under a balsam fir
Then I set down the asphalt streets, which disintegrated into the front lawns of prefab houses
All of them, white, aluminum-sided
All of them: bookended, with porches and two-car garages, crowned with satellite dishes, fronted with pickup trucks
After dinner I sometimes took the canoe out and lingered after dark--especially on overcast nights, especially after nine, when twilight finally halved, and then halved again, sliding the sky through epochs of orange, then epochs of blue and purple
"Other reviewers have written that they are not sure what the novel is about
 But what may appear muddled very appropriately reflects the musings of an adolescent trying to make sense of her world
 A common theme runs through the seemingly disconnected subplots: what is more important, our internal truths"" or our external reality? And are the consequences of our actions judged by our assumptions or our intentions, or even by whether we are reactive, proactive, or passive? There is much to ponder here, both from the point of view of a teenage girl, and from her grown-up 37 year old self"
and the two are not much different
One lingering question is, do we really mature with our passing years? Those who felt puzzled by the novel might benefit from a second read after knowing where the story ultimately goes
I, for one, am tempted
even though I rarely read anything twice
But this one was such a rich and engrossing read that I might just turn back again to page 1--if only to re-experience Ms
Fridlund's exquisite prose
