ExitWest	Mohsin Hamid
Exit West is one of those novels that I’m still puzzling over, some time after finishing it
The author makes some interesting choices in terms of technique
So this review is really my reflections up to now rather than a settled opinion
First, Exit West is narrated by an omniscient narrator with a cool, detached voice
This adds to the sense that the events it describes are normal, unsurprising
It tells the story of Saeed and Nadia, who live in an unnamed city in a country on the brink of civil war
Saeed has light stubble and Nadia wears a black robe, at a time when people could still choose what to wear, ‘so these choices meant something’
They become involved and in contrast to their appearances, it is Nadia who has broken with expectations by living independently, estranged from her family, while Saeed still lives at home
At first they do the things new couples do
They text incessantly
They use recreational drugs by moonlight
They listen to music and negotiate their attitudes to sex
But the civil war takes first their freedom and then their safety
It seems like the only option is to escape
Saeed and Nadia leave through one of the ‘doors’ by which refugees leave war zones, generally after handing over money to traffickers
The ‘doors’ open and close apparently randomly, offering an abrupt dislocation from one place to another
It suggests something magical, without human agency, while the reality is anything but
While Saeed and Nadia’s home city is unnamed, the events described feel contemporary and real
However the places where they go after they leave, which are named, known locations, are subtly different, as if we’re looking at a possible future or an alternate reality
They are in social upheaval, they are more segregated, even less hopeful than they are now
Then there are vignettes throughout the book interrupting the main narrative, showing immigrants and refugees in other regions suddenly appearing through doors, as if to remind us that this is happening everywhere, all the time
Saeed and Nadia are well realised characters, at once unique and recognisable
As they leave their home the narrative fragments and their stories become less absorbing
It is as if in becoming refugees, whose main preoccupation is survival, whose choices are circumscribed, they have less time to be psychologically complex and interesting, not only to a reader but perhaps to themselves
So while the story didn’t engage me throughout the book, the ideas did, and still do
Exit West challenges you to think in new ways about a familiar issue, to question what you understand when you see generic terms like refugee or migrant applied to millions of individuals, who each has their home, their emotional life, their door, and has to make the decision to take that chance, or not, while they can
