HomeFire	Kamila Shamsie
Home Fire is that rare beast: a novel with really important points to make while also being a cracking read	Rev
Through the eyes of five characters, we get a dissection of what it means to be British-Asian in the current world	Char
Initially, we meet Isma, resuming a career in academia in the US after bringing up her orphaned younger siblings in London	Sum
Picking up her former life does not start well as she is detained by security at Heathrow Airport and misses her flight	Sum
Then we meet Eamonn, the son of the British Home Secretary [insert name]	Sum
His father, as a Muslim politician, is keen to distance himself from extremism by introducing ever-more draconian laws to contain the “threat”	Sum
Eamonn is a spoilt rich kid who finds contact with other British Pakistanis way more confronting than mixing with the white, public school elite	Sum
Then, the high point for me, we travel with Parvaiz, Isma’s younger brother, to Raqqa to join the Caliphate	Sum
This is a portrait of hope, naivity and a desperation to belong to a family, shattered to smithereens when reality bites	Sto
But thanks to modern anti-terror laws, there is no way back from such a decision	O
In very few words, Shamsie created a living, breathing world and a highly conflicted character who goes on a major journey of self-discovery	Char
Then back to Britain with Parvaiz’s twin sister Aneeka, and the final two chapters in the company of the Home Secretary himself, Karamat Lone	Sum
Lone is a monster, a self-serving egotist who has no understanding of - and even less care about – the impact of his policies on those affected by them	Sum
Even when they touch his own family, he is willing to sacrifice their rights for his own political career	Sum
And what is the point of that career – the power – if he only uses it to try to perpetuate it?	Sto
But I think that does the novel a disservice	Rev
This is not a recasting of an ancient Greek play; it is not derivative	Sto
It is a searing critique of the conflicts of identity; of personal interest and family loyalty within a community that is being vilified on a daily basis	Sto
How far can it be right to punish an easily identifiable group for the transgressions of some of its members; how far should those who do transgress be dealt with through the existing judicial system or how far can it be right to expel them from the system altogether?	Sto
This novel spans half the globe, offers five very different stories, and poses difficult questions	Sto
There is not a wrong word in this tight narrative, spanning ultra-realism through to the absolutely surreal	WS
By the end, the story is in a slow motion, dream-like sequence	WS
And the ending is absolutely not expected	Sto
Home Fire is a really fantastic novel but, if it has one Achilles Heel, it could be its fixation in the present moment	Rev
The novel relies on the current public mood, the current legal (and illegal) situation, the current conflict in Syria	O
Move on five years – perhaps less – and what seems to immediate now may seem very fleeting and out of date	O
I hope the future is not as bleak as Home Fire would have us believe	Rev
