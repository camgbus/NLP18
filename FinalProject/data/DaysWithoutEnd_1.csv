DaysWithoutEnd 	Sebastian Barry
Absorbing and entertaining, thought-provoking and at times painful	Rev
The love story was a bit of a surprise, but I liked the natural, low-key way in which it was introduced and carried out	Sto
Although technically a Western, I think this story transcends that genre and is simply a moving and well-written tale of adventure and war, love and loss, and how we make our own version of family and home when the mold doesn't fit	Sto
Highly recommend	Rev
