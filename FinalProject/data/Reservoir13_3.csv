Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
This is classic Booker long list
The precipitating event- the disappearance of a young girl and the impact on the village where she went missing is tracked year by year, chapter by chapter
Life does have a certain sameness (monotony) to it, especially nature, but that's not always fun to read
This is not a mystery or a procedural, it's a slow examination
Regrettably for me, it didn't gel
There have been other novels with this same theme this year and perhaps because I read them first, this quiet and well written book did not grab me
Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC
Try this if you are a fan of thoughtful British fiction
