Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
This book almost feels like it's written by a non-human intelligence	WS
It's the story of a village as a whole, with nearly as much attention paid to the landscape and nature as to the people	Sto
It's as much concerned with patterns and continuity as it is with discrete events	Sto
And yet at the same time it's full of humanity: the good, the bad and the bland	Sto
