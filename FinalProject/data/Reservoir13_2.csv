Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
Thanks to NetGalley and to Fourth State for offering me an ARC copy of this book that I freely chose to review
I had never read one of Jon McGregor’s novels before but I was curious by the description of this novel and more curious when I saw it had been long-listed for the Man Booker Prize
The biography of the author intrigued me even more and I finally managed to read the book
The book starts with the disappearance of a thirteen-year-old girl, a visitor holidaying, with her parents, to a village in Britain (not too distant from Manchester and also near enough to Leeds and Sheffield for those cities to make appearances, so probably in the general area where I live)
Despite a large search party and much publicity and community effort, the girl does not appear
At first, everything is stopped: Council meetings, Christmas celebrations, the lives of her parents who remain in the village for a long time
Slowly, things go back to almost normal, with only the anniversary of her disappearance as a reminder that something tragic happened there
Life returns to its natural rhythms
There are births, deaths, people get married, separate, get new jobs, are made redundant, people move into the village and out, cricket matches are lost (mostly), the weather is very wet, and occasionally dry, the reservoirs are checked, the quarries exploited or not, there are pantomimes, well-dressing, Mischief nights, birds come and go, clocks go back and forth, foxes are born, bats hibernate, crimes are committed, crops harvested, farm animals looked after… The novel (if it is a novel) is a slice of the life of the community of that village
The story is told in the third person from an omniscient point of view, and one that seems to be an objective observer that peeps into people’s heads (and observes animals) but without becoming over involved with feelings, just describing what people might think, but not going any further than that
The style of writing is peculiar, and perhaps not suited to everybody’s taste
There are very beautiful sentences and a particular rhythm to the paragraphs, which are not divided according to the different characters’ points of view or stories and can go from weather to animals to a person’s actions
Each anniversary of the girl’s disappearance marks a new year, but, otherwise, there is little to differentiate what happens, other than the chronology and the passing of time for the characters, the houses, and the village itself
There are no individual characters that have a bigger share of the limelight
We have the youngsters, who had known the missing girl, and we follow them, but we also follow the female priest, the teachers at school, several farmers, a potter, the newspaper editor and his wife, the school keeper and his sister… We get to know a fair bit about each one of them but not at an emotional level, and we become observers too, rather than putting ourselves in the place of the characters to share their feelings and thoughts
It makes for a strange reading experience, and not one everybody will enjoy
It is as if we were supposed to let the words wash over us and explore a different way of reading, pretty much like the passing of life itself
There is no resolution (there isn’t in life either) and I have read quite a few reviews where readers were disappointed as they kept reading waiting for some sort of final reveal that never comes
We are used to classic narratives with beginning, middle, and end, and being confronted by a different kind of structure can make us uncomfortable
This novel reminded me, in some ways, of the film The Tree of Life directed by Terrence Malick, although in that case, the story was more circumscribed and here it is more choral (and less involved)
Reviewers who know McGregor’s previous work are not in agreement about this novel, as some feel it shows a development of his style and is the best of his yet, whilst others prefer some of his earlier work
My advice to those who have never read him would be to check a sample of the novel and see how they feel (although, remember that the earlier focus on the search for the girl dies down later)
This is not a spoiler as the author has said saw in quite a few interviews and it is clear from the description that this is not a mystery novel
In sum, this is a novel for people interested in new and post-modern writing, rather than for those looking for a conventional story
If you are annoyed by head hopping and strange writing techniques and like to find a clear ending, then stay away from it
If you enjoy meditation and savouring every moment and are prepared for a different type of reading, you might be in for a treat
