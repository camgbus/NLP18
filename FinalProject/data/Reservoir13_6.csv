Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
The novel starts off with the disappearance of a young girl, Rebecca Shaw, off the moors of a sleepy English village, and the search for her	Sum
When that dies down, the reader realises this isn’t quite a mystery novel, but something more aligned with McGregor’s debut novel, “If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things”	Sum
What ensues are slice-of-life vignettes about the inhabitants of the village, and though they are helpfully named (unlike in the aforementioned novel), I got terribly lost in the mire of characters and their relationships	Char
Perhaps the group of teenagers who were around the missing girl’s age stood out with greater clarity, and their progress through their teenage years to early adulthood, with their revolving door of couplings and breakups, helped mark the passing of time in the otherwise timeless village, but they too, faded from view and reappeared at seemingly inconspicuous moments of the novel	Char
While McGregor should be applauded for his ability to capture the pulse and rhythm of life in a rural community through his microscopic lens and his keen observation of the passing seasons and the details of the natural environs, it felt like an overly long novel that should have stayed a short story, with too large a cast of characters that causes the novel to lose its focus and direction	WS
What felt even more deceptive and distracting was the case of the missing girl in the first place, which McGregor brings up periodically just as the press and media does throughout the decade or so of the the story’s timeline, but which is never solved, making the whole piece look like a landscape painting with no apparent focal point to draw the reader’s eye on, which at best felt like a journal that just went on and on and on	Sum
Given the brilliance of his debut novel, I felt this was a letdown that showed you can’t use the same literary technique on any canvas, even if it worked well for you that one time	Rev
