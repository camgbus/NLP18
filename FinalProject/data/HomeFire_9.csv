HomeFire	Kamila Shamsie
I’ve seen it mentioned in other reviews that Home Fire is meant to be loosely based on the story of Antigone	Rev
Not being particularly well-versed in the plays of Sophocles, I read this more as a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet	Rev
It is not surprising that people are noticing classical antecedents for Home Fire in one way or another because this novel has a mythical and timeless quality to it	Sto
There is a multi-generational clash of families and a doomed love affair, for example	Sto
There are also two sisters of nearly opposite temperaments who are faced with difficult, life-altering decisions	Sto
There is the backdrop of war and terrorism overlaid with the personal drama of conflicting loyalties	Sto
And there is the inevitable tragic ending that is too much to be believed	Sto
(There is also a lot of ice applied to a corpse over a number of days, but I won’t get into that	Sum
) All in all, I was awed by Shamsie’s ability to weave a complex and heartbreaking story while shifting the narrative perspective among several characters (a structural device that is very in vogue at the moment)	Char
The last 20% got a bit absurd for my tastes (ice+corpse+days), and the writing/voice didn’t stand out to me as particularly beautiful or unique, so it’s four stars for me	WS
