HomeFire	Kamila Shamsie
I’ve seen it mentioned in other reviews that Home Fire is meant to be loosely based on the story of Antigone
Not being particularly well-versed in the plays of Sophocles, I read this more as a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet
It is not surprising that people are noticing classical antecedents for Home Fire in one way or another because this novel has a mythical and timeless quality to it
There is a multi-generational clash of families and a doomed love affair, for example
There are also two sisters of nearly opposite temperaments who are faced with difficult, life-altering decisions
There is the backdrop of war and terrorism overlaid with the personal drama of conflicting loyalties
And there is the inevitable tragic ending that is too much to be believed
(There is also a lot of ice applied to a corpse over a number of days, but I won’t get into that
) All in all, I was awed by Shamsie’s ability to weave a complex and heartbreaking story while shifting the narrative perspective among several characters (a structural device that is very in vogue at the moment)
The last 20% got a bit absurd for my tastes (ice+corpse+days), and the writing/voice didn’t stand out to me as particularly beautiful or unique, so it’s four stars for me
