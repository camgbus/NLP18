TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
The bones of the story should be known by everyone of every race and culture in America
The author doesn't protect the reader from the truly awful aspects of slavery
It is a rather rapid read and based upon first-person accounts
The use of a literal railroad was a surprise but it is an effective tool around which the story is told
I'm just not sure I agree that it should have won the Pulitzer as well as the National Book Award
There were other novels under consideration which were more subtle and I think better written
However, this is a must-read for everyone and I think most will be happy to have read it
