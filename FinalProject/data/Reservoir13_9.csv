Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
I was given an ARC of this book by the publisher via NetGalley and voluntarily reviewed it
I had a good time reading Reservoir 13
There’s something I really like about the narrative style used in the book, sort of an omnipotent point of view allowing vivid descriptions of the world the characters inhabit as well as intimate details about the characters
This style reminds me of the only other novel I’ve read by the author, If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things
I enjoyed the way the novel is structured; there are no chapters but the novel is split into little vignettes of different lengths which focus on a particular character or event
Reservoir 13 addresses a lot of big issues revolving around the cycle of life and death and is quite poignant at times
I found the book very sad at times, especially when the passage of time is marked by saying how old the missing girl would have been
It took me ages to read this book, not because it’s a bad book but because it’s the kind of book that needs to be read slowly so the rich, vivid detail can be absorbed and savoured
