ExitWest	Mohsin Hamid
Once in a while I come across a novel that makes me wish I were teaching again, a novel that begs for questions and discussion
This is one of those novels
Its brevity belies its complexity
Its characters -- main, minor, fleeting, and implied -- represent humanity as it is today
Its premise, while fanciful, creates the opportunity for readers to wonder if we have the courage to radically change how we view others and the world in which we all live
I read in a review that this is a hopeful novel and initially I was suspicious that a novel centering on the plight of innocent refugees fleeing violence and death could ultimately proffer a hopeful message
But hope there is despite the literal impossibility of its central plot device
The doors are a metaphor; do we have the courage to open them to those with the courage to walk through? Told in a spare but descriptive narrative, Mr
Hamid challenges his readers to open their minds to the possibilities that the future holds
