TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
This is an amazing book	Rev
It's often hard to read (emotionally, not that it is difficult to understand)	WS
A few times I had to put it down -- it wasn't a book I could read in large chunks	Rev
However, I'm very glad that I read it	Rev
Whitehead brings a lyrical style to one of the ugliest portions of our history	WS
By turning the railroad into a literal thing, he changes the reality enough to allow readers to see it all through fresh eyes	WS
This, and other subtle changes to the history, keep readers on their toes and off-balance	Rev
Just as Cora doesn't know what will be waiting for her at various stops, neither do we	Rev
Highest recommendation	Rev
