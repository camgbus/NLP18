TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
This is an amazing book
It's often hard to read (emotionally, not that it is difficult to understand)
A few times I had to put it down -- it wasn't a book I could read in large chunks
However, I'm very glad that I read it
Whitehead brings a lyrical style to one of the ugliest portions of our history
By turning the railroad into a literal thing, he changes the reality enough to allow readers to see it all through fresh eyes
This, and other subtle changes to the history, keep readers on their toes and off-balance
Just as Cora doesn't know what will be waiting for her at various stops, neither do we
Highest recommendation
