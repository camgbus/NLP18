TheMinistryOfUtmostHappiness	Arundhati Roy
"In this anarchic novel of fragmented, symbolic narratives of India's outcasts, there is the idea of a truly great work of art for the 21st Century, an equivalent of anarchist sociologist Rebecca Solnit's vision of ""A Paradise Built in Hell"
"There are times, especially toward the end of the book, where the narrative itself gains the immediacy and power of its ambitions
 There's a taut account of violence, terrorism, and love in the insurgency in Kashmir and a poetic canvass of a community living in a Delhi graveyard, where society's outcasts build a New Jerusalem
 Unfortunately, for me and apparently for a good many other readers as well, a lot of the book sags
 It feels as if Arundhati Roy does not quite have her heart in it or believe her own idea, and that hollows out some of the writing
 (There's even one section where one of the characters, Tilo, with more than a faint resemblance to Roy, speculates on writing a bad novel: she may have sensed that it was not going well
) If this book had arrived at a publisher's from an unknown writer, it either would not have been published or would have been massively edited
 The former would have been sad; the latter might have saved it
 Meanwhile, for the American reader, there is a lot of vivid and informative writing about India and much of today's world
 For some, it would be more accessible in Roy's non-fiction such as Capitalism: A Ghost Story"
