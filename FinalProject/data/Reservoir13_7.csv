Reservoir13	Jon McGregor
In a village in England, a 13-year-old girl goes missing, but Time, that heartless bastard, just keeps on truckin’
Weeks, months, and years go by
Lambs, foxes, bats, badgers, bugs, and babies are born
Marriages are created and destroyed (and sometimes, re-created)
Children grow up to be teenagers
First they experiment with alcohol, and then with each other
They go away to college and sometimes come back—but they’re never the same
The missing girl (or at least that last-known-sighting version of her) becomes an H
G
Wells-like time-traveler—The seasons that go round and round at a dizzying pace change everything—except for that one untouchable image
This is not a novel for everyone—probably not even a novel for most
Maybe not even a novel: If a town could keep a diary, would that be novel? Perhaps, it’s _her_ diary
It’s not an easy read—there are no main characters, but something on the order of 20-25 significant characters
Some readers will throw in the towel rather than face that onslaught (I very nearly did)
The novel would be a _great_ one for discussing in a book group—the problem is, some folks would probably hate you for asking them to read it
It’s beautifully written, and though classic in style, really pushes the envelope in terms of what I think of as a novel
For me, it was worth the effort, but not a book I would dare recommend to anyone else—they will have to discover it (or not) for themselves
