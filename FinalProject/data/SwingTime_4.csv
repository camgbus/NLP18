SwingTime	Zadie Smith
Swing Time gives you a view of living poor and half-white in London
Two girl friends growing up there end up with very different lives
One is a dancer but her self-destructive behavior brings her to a dead end
One becomes the assistant of a famous rock star and becomes involved on her do-good project in Africa
Thus you you get a glimpse of 4 very different communities: New York, London high life, London low life, and African village life
