TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
I chose this book, frankly, because Oprah chose it for her book club
As a lower middle class white child, educated in the '60's, I was well aware of the segregated south, but I had no idea the depth of the degradation and depravity of what people of color had endured in this country
The land of the free, home of the brave
unless you were a person of color
Kidnapped from your village in Africa, sold into bondage
IF you had survived the arduous journey from the Dark Continent to the Americas
Seeing your heritage stripped from you, as surely as your dignity and humanity as you stood on the auctioneers' block
Bearing children, only to see them torn from you to satisfy your master's debts
I am sure that these atrocities were part of my education, but this novel brings them more to the forefront than any textbook ever did
Even my college textbooks were circumspect in their description of man's inhumanity to man
For example, I did not know that all abolitionists were not involver in the underground railroad for purely altruistic reasons
"Some actually used the newly ""freed"" slaved for medical research, delivering them from one sort of subhuman bondage to another"
This book is a real Eye-opener for anyone educated in the public school system 
Our textbooks did NOT tell the whole story
This novel gives a glimpse into the hardships and injustices we really never grasped in our American History class
An easy, if unsettling, read for this white girl!
