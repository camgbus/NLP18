SwingTime	Zadie Smith
Zadie Smith builds unforgettable characters
They are honest, flawed, real, and yet give you a reason to empathize or like them
This is no small feat
Smith's writing is beautifully crafted, even lyrical at times
Swing Time is a modern day coming-of-age tale set in London, NY and Africa and has strong roots in dance
It explores cultures, relationships, media & social media, fame and jealousy, justice, drive and death
This would make a great book club read
