SolarBones	Mike McCormack
This book was almost as difficult to review as it was to read	Rev
In some places the writing is excellent and Marcus Conway's rambling and rather boring story of his life told without capitalization or periods is a curiosity meant for the living who don't realize their time is running out, but at others, it is a droning and uninteresting waste of time	WS
I realize the previous sentence makes little sense and was probably annoying to read	WS
So is this book	WS
Although McCormick clearly knows how to write and does show so on occasion, a 200+ page book made up of one sentence that's basically a droning reflection of a somewhat boring Irishman's life, just isn't worth the effort	WS
Disappointing	Rev
