HomeFire	Kamila Shamsie
Political strife, a family torn apart multiple times, love lost and found, and tragedy make up Kamila Shamsie’s novel HOME FIRE
Isma, the eldest sister, a devout Muslim and the head of her British family, has practically raised her younger sister Aneeka and brother Parvaiz, who are twins
Their mother and grandmother have passed away
Isma has gone away to graduate school in the States
Parvaiz has left town to supposedly travel, while Aneeka is pursuing a law degree
They know only anecdotes of their deceased jihadi father who left to fight in Afghanistan
Isma meets Eammon, the handsome son of the home secretary, once a rival of her father’s, who has denounced his Muslim background, married to a wealthy American, and worked his way up the political system
Eammon infiltrates, by accident or perhaps not, her family back in London and hooks up with the younger sister
When he tells his father of his impending plans, all hell breaks loose
This is the real world
Where ISIS is stronger than young love
Family members take sides
And politics have the upper hand in the modern world
