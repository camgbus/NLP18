TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
I've been a big Colson Whitehead fan since 'The Intuitionist' and this is another great novel by one of America's best writers
A postmodern examination of the institution of slavery and racism in America
The metaphorical railroad to freedom becomes a literal nightmare, and to a woman born a slave, freedom seems ephemeral even in the Northern States
The sad tragedies of the book are unfortunately based on real events, and it gives the reader pause to think, are African Americans safe even in American today?
