HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
You have to ask yourself, from the beginning, what do you think you know?	Sto
Wow	Rev
I'm in awe of this book	Rev
It's ceaselessly enthralling from the opening sentence, like a puzzle that demands to be solved despite your knowing, deep down, that it's not going to be pretty	Sto
There's a relentless sense of foreboding throughout the entire thing	Sto
Something is wrong—but what?	Sto
Who is predator, and who is prey? 	Sto
Linda, our unreliable narrator, is a strange, isolated high school student living in rural Minnesota	Sum
There are lots of heavy things happening around her, like, for example, her history teacher getting arrested for child pornography	Sum
When a mysterious couple with a young boy moves into the cabin across the lake, Linda becomes the boy's designated babysitter, spending every afternoon with him and developing a sense of kinship and belonging with his young mother	Sum
We get the sense early on that something bad is going to happen, but we don't know what	Sum
Fridlund takes her time with the reveal(s), but the pacing is never frustrating	WS
The narration jumps around in time without warning, and the effect is deliberately disorienting	WS
It makes sense for a story as obscure and peculiar as this one though	Rev
There are breaches between action and thought, guilt and innocence, trust and doubt, predator and prey—and what dwells in those gray areas isn't always clear, even upon years of reflection	Sto
"At one point, as an adult, Linda wonders, ""What's the difference between what you want to believe and what you do? "	Sto
And what's the difference between what you think and what you end up doing?	Sto
These questions lie at the heart of this exquisite novel, and there are no easy answers	Sto
This is such a brilliant, thought-provoking, uncomfortable, deeply layered book	Sto
Fridlund writes with precision and purpose, delivering a dark, gorgeous, beguiling debut	WS
I'll be recommending this one to everyone	Rev
