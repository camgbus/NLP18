HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
"We sometimes use the expression ""raised by wolves"" to imply that a person is wild or doesn't have any social skills"
It is not a compliment
Emily Fridlund may or may not have considered this when she chose the title for her novel, HISTORY OF WOLVES, but it certainly comes to mind when considering the main character and narrator, Linda, an eighth grader from northern Minnesota
"Linda lives in ""The Walleye Capital of the World"" with former hippie/commune-living parents who continued in cabins near the water long after the commune broke up"
Linda's parents scratch out a living on the land and in the small town miles away
Linda scratches out a living in school where no one cares for her
She is, actually, a strange girl who keeps to herself and goes through life silently observing everything around her, both in nature and in the world
Linda walks a great distance to get to school in thrift shop clothes, never seeming to have enough warm clothing
She sleeps in a loft her father put above her parents' bed in the one room cabin that holds their lives together with thick quilts and left over stuff that is all they have
Linda knows her dogs well, seems to commune with them and tramps through the forest with them, her only companions
Excitement enters Linda's life when she gets a new history teacher, Mr
Grierson, a tanned dude with an earring from California
He and a classmate, Lily, start to form the story that will take up the novel and create the secrets Linda holds inside for years to come
More outsiders, in the shape of a family, move into a new cabin across the lake from Linda's house and she becomes a babysitter for their four-year-old child, Paul
She gets along with Paul who doesn't like being told to do things by his mother
Linda shows him her world outside the cabin, and he thrills to the adventures they have all around the lake
Much of this novel is about the separateness and individual lives, about children who are not taken care of by family or friends
I don't think that Linda's parents didn't love her, they were still living the commune mind set where familial bonds and connections were an anathema to their way of life
"Linda's mother called her ""the teenager"" with more than a hint of sarcasm, but her father silently brought her close to him when they stood side by side cleaning the fish he caught in season"
She created fantasies about Lily, trying to befriend her
She beamed when Mr
Grierson showed that he thought she was smart
The events that move the plot of EF's novel are laid out in such a nuanced fashion that I had to keep reminding myself that serious things were going on
Seen through Linda's eyes, a ninth grader, could all this be happening? It takes distance and years before she can reconcile everything and decide what she wanted to have in her life that would give her peace and comfort
This novel is complex and rich in a coming-of-age narrative that breaks lots of rules
It isn't a fairy tale of American wealth and privilege, not even middle-class boredom
It is rich with hard scrabble experiences that most of us have never known and I felt enriched with EF's gift of the story
