HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
It may not be obvious to all readers but the narrator of this novel is autistic
Mild autism is called Aspergers
She is high functioning
She often misses body language cues in social situations
She has several intense interests including her over-riding interest in wolves
She is NOT popular at school, and is often victimized by the rudeness and bullying of others
Her mother calls her a “Little Professor,” a term used to describe autistic children when the condition was first identified
Most of the story is about her relationship with the Gardner family that lives across the lake
The father Leo studies the stars, and practices strict Christian Science; the mother Patra eats spilled popcorn off the floor and four year old Paul is at times precocious and at other times unreasonable
Maybe that is the way four year olds are
The narrator is Madeline, but she calls herself Linda when she’s with Paul’s family
Patra is really Cleopatra
Sometimes people who don’t fit well into social situations change the spelling of their names
They think the change of name will somehow change them
Clearly Patra is lonely and uncomfortable in her marriage to the overbearing Leo
Madeline/Linda tries to be Patra by wearing Patra’s headband even though it hurts her scalp and gives her headaches
In many ways Madeline/Linda has taken over the duties of being Paul’s mother
This too can be physically painful at times like when he has a tantrum and scratches her face with his fingernail
This book is about people who don’t fit well into society
Unlike wolves who respect family and community, these characters are outsiders uncomfortable in the wider community
Besides Madeline/Linda and the Gardner family, we have Mr
Grierson, the pedophile history teacher, and Lily, the beautiful Ojibwa Indian who finds herself pregnant in the tenth grade
People who don’t fit in are often fascinated by others who also don’t fit in
They try to help each other
Madeline/Linda steals a pair of boots from the school’s Lost and Found Box and gives them to Lily
She follows the pedophile’s trial, and using the Internet she trails him around the country
She remembers that he did NOT take advantage of her when he drove her home one night, and that he could recite the entire Declaration of Independence from memory
She believes that he is innocent
I read other reviews that called the characters losers
I disagree
These characters are vulnerable
We need to pay more attention to people like them
We need to include them in community
In this novel, for instance, the guilt of the pedophile is questionable
The autistic narrator is undiagnosed
We often refer to wolves as predators
They aren’t
We also define each other, with terms like teenager, babysitter, Girl Scout
These terms are used to describe Madeline/Linda
She’s also compared to the Tarot card, the Fool
She is NOT a fool, but she is more than just what the other labels imply
This is novel for serious readers
The chapter sections are written more like personal essays than like parts of a novel
The time line can be confusing
But it is a very worthwhile read
