HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
It may not be obvious to all readers but the narrator of this novel is autistic	Sum
Mild autism is called Aspergers	O
She is high functioning	Sum
She often misses body language cues in social situations	Sum
She has several intense interests including her over-riding interest in wolves	Sum
She is NOT popular at school, and is often victimized by the rudeness and bullying of others	Sum
Her mother calls her a “Little Professor,” a term used to describe autistic children when the condition was first identified	Sum
Most of the story is about her relationship with the Gardner family that lives across the lake	Sto
The father Leo studies the stars, and practices strict Christian Science; the mother Patra eats spilled popcorn off the floor and four year old Paul is at times precocious and at other times unreasonable	Sum
Maybe that is the way four year olds are	O
The narrator is Madeline, but she calls herself Linda when she’s with Paul’s family	Sum
Patra is really Cleopatra	Sum
Sometimes people who don’t fit well into social situations change the spelling of their names	O
They think the change of name will somehow change them	O
Clearly Patra is lonely and uncomfortable in her marriage to the overbearing Leo	Sum
Madeline/Linda tries to be Patra by wearing Patra’s headband even though it hurts her scalp and gives her headaches	Sum
In many ways Madeline/Linda has taken over the duties of being Paul’s mother	Sum
This too can be physically painful at times like when he has a tantrum and scratches her face with his fingernail	Sum
This book is about people who don’t fit well into society	Sto
Unlike wolves who respect family and community, these characters are outsiders uncomfortable in the wider community	Char
Besides Madeline/Linda and the Gardner family, we have Mr. Grierson, the pedophile history teacher, and Lily, the beautiful Ojibwa Indian who finds herself pregnant in the tenth grade	Sum
People who don’t fit in are often fascinated by others who also don’t fit in	O
They try to help each other	O
Madeline/Linda steals a pair of boots from the school’s Lost and Found Box and gives them to Lily	Sum
She follows the pedophile’s trial, and using the Internet she trails him around the country	Sum
She remembers that he did NOT take advantage of her when he drove her home one night, and that he could recite the entire Declaration of Independence from memory	Sum
She believes that he is innocent	Sum
I read other reviews that called the characters losers	Char
I disagree	Rev
These characters are vulnerable	Char
We need to pay more attention to people like them	Rev
We need to include them in community	Rev
In this novel, for instance, the guilt of the pedophile is questionable	Char
The autistic narrator is undiagnosed	Char
We often refer to wolves as predators	O
They aren’t	O
We also define each other, with terms like teenager, babysitter, Girl Scout	O
These terms are used to describe Madeline/Linda	Sum
She’s also compared to the Tarot card, the Fool	Sum
She is NOT a fool, but she is more than just what the other labels imply	Sum
This is novel for serious readers	Rev
The chapter sections are written more like personal essays than like parts of a novel	WS
The time line can be confusing	WS
But it is a very worthwhile read	Rev
