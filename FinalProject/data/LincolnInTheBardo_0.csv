LincolnInTheBardo	George Saunders
"Before you crack open George Saunders' new (first) novel, ""Lincoln in the Bardo"", you must empty your mind of what you expect an historical novel to be"	Rev
Both the structure and the narrative are incredibly non-traditional, somewhat experimental, often disorienting, but ultimately fulfilling	WS
Let me assure you that if you open your mind, you'll not only get used to it, you will enjoy it thoroughly	Rev
"That said, I think ""Lincoln in the Bardo"" would work even better as a stage play, somewhat reminiscent of ""Our Town"", and in this sense I think an audio recording of the novel, if done well, might be the best way to experience this work"	Rev
"Bardo is a Tibetan word for the ""in-between"" or ""transitional"" state between lives (thank you, Wikipedia)"	O
The novel takes place in one night in a cemetery and the story is narrated by hundreds of voices: old and young, men, women, and children, white and black, salve and free	Sum
These denizens of Saunders' novel are in a place between life and death	Sum
We are told that people stay in this gray area for varying periods of time and that children usually stay there a very short time (this is where it also sounded a lot like Purgatory to me)	Sum
"Do these ""beings"" know that they are actually dead?"	Sto
"They use words like ""sick box"" for coffin, and ""sick-form"" for body, ""white stone home"" for mausoleum, so they seem to be unclear as to their actual state"	Sum
Through these voices Saunders creates as fascinating (and chilling) a version of the after-life as Dante Alighieri gave us	Sto
(There is a particularly interesting and notable discussion among them about free will in the latter part of the novel	Sto
) The basic plot is fictionalized history: Willie, Abraham Lincoln's young son, has died and he is now in the Bardo	Sum
Here we meet the many fascinating - and funny! characters who show Willie around, who witness the unusual sight of Lincoln cradling the body of his young son, and who endeavor to help both father and son to find peace	Sum
"That's as far as I will go with the ""plot"" of this novel"	Rev
"One of my favorite things about this unique novel, was how Saunders presented conflicting ""news reports"""	WS
"For example, when reporting on the White House gala reception the night Willie is dying, some ""witnesses"" said there was a full moon, some said there was no moon, some said it was green, some red, others said it was just a sliver"	WS
This serves to remind us that recorded history is just as unreliable as our current news reporting	Sto
What is the truth?	Sto
Do we ever know? 	Sto
"For the purpose of ""Lincoln in the Bardo"", we only need to know that the Lincolns did lose their beloved son Willie in early 1862, all else is brilliantly imagined and ""reported"" by"	O
"Ultimately ""Lincoln in the Bardo"" is a riveting exploration of death, grief, and love told in an utterly unique, almost poetic, fashion"	Sto
