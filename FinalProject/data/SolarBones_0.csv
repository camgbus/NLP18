SolarBones	Mike McCormack
The experience of reading this wonderful novel is defined by the choice Mike McCormack has made to write the whole work as a single sentence	WS
There is not a single period to interrupt the graceful and eloquent flow of Marcus Conway's internal monologue as he wanders through his empty home--everyone in the family is out somewhere--noticing details, narrating associations and memories of events prompted by objects, recalling his parents and his early life, shifting from one period or relationship to another as he encounters new connections	WS
There are times when his narrative voice is detailed and factual, others when he either describes the emotional responses of others or is overwhelmed by his own emotions; there are times when his reminiscences are voiced in a style that evokes memories of Seamus Heaney's autobiographical poems, sharing some of the power of Heaney's words and vision	WS
Objects sometimes take on an uncanny power--Marcus notices that the dining table is covered with a white cloth that is usually only set out at Christmas, though the time is October/November	Sto
This is noted, but not discussed	O
As with other material objects and persons, their significance to him is apparent, but their relevance to his situation as he narrates is left to the reader to infer	WS
The narrator, Marcus, is a civil engineer living in the west country of Ireland (County Mayo), who is responsible for public works in his area	Sum
He is committed to designing and maintaining public works (roads, bridges, some buildings) that are both well-constructed and safe, as well as pleasing to their users	Sum
"He is also an intelligent and sensitive man, devoted to his wife and children, though his relationships to both his daughter,( an aspiring artist whose first solo exhibition opens as a major event in the narrative), and his son, (who is on a round-the-world ""quest,"" mostly in Australia during the period of the main narrative), must be described as complicated, sometimes marred by mutual incomprehension or diverging ambitions and hopes"	Sum
"The children are clearly denizens of the contemporary era of the internet and Skype, postmodern ""installations"" and relative uninterest in preparing for the ""future,"" and though Marcus tries hard to comprehend their thinking and behavior, and clings to his wife in spite of occasional sharp disagreements about the family dynamic, he is most comfortably rooted in certain traditional values that cluster in the meanings of the words ""integrity"" and ""loyalty"	Sum
He is, one might say, one of the most difficult kinds of characters to portray convincingly--a good man	Char
That McCormack succeeds in making him sympathetic and convincing, without ignoring his limitations, is an achievement	Char
This is a beautiful and compelling work	Rev
"Most readers will adjust quickly to the strangeness of reading a sentence that continues unabated for the whole narrative, required only to make a conscious decision to stop here for now"" if that is necessary, since the usual signals (sentences, paragraph endings, chapter divisions) are not available to offer a logical intermission point"	WS
This is not an unheard of choice, of course--there are other one sentence novels, though most are more complex and experimental, whereas McCormack's continuous sentence flows smoothly, with only a few jolts where the narrator is himself jolted by an unexpected or traumatic experience into a sudden shift of focus	WS
Certainly no reader should hesitate to enter the mind of Marcus because of the stylistic choices McCormack has made	Rev
The explorations of love, marriage, parenthood, work and aspiration, friendship or the lack of it, belief and unbelief, all the matters of daily life and the questions that enliven it (or cause frustration in it) are thoughtful, as is the narrator, and often moving	Sto
The inexorable progress toward the wrenching end is both engaging and sometimes inspiring	Sto
This is probably not the best novel that McCormack will have given us--I hope to read more of his work in the future	Rev
