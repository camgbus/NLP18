I have never read a book like this before	Rev
I do not believe that a book like this has ever been written before	Rev
It is, unquestionably, an original	WS
I won't describe it to you	Rev
Others have done that	O
But get prepared to stick with the read as you realize that this one sentence runs for over two hundred pages	WS
I know: you are used to simple sentences, paragraphs, set-pieces, chapters	WS
You will find this a challenge, similar to climbing a cliff face with only your fingernails	Rev
No ledges to get a respite, no markers outlining the next segment of the climb	O
Only the inability to lose your grip, only the compunction to climb to the very summit	O
But, if you stick with it, it's a climb like no other	Rev
It's a reading journey you've never had	O
And probably will never have again	O
