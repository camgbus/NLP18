I have never read a book like this before
I do not believe that a book like this has ever been written before
It is, unquestionably, an original
I won't describe it to you
Others have done that
But get prepared to stick with the read as you realize that this one sentence runs for over two hundred pages
I know: you are used to simple sentences, paragraphs, set-pieces, chapters
You will find this a challenge, similar to climbing a cliff face with only your fingernails
No ledges to get a respite, no markers outlining the next segment of the climb
Only the inability to lose your grip, only the compunction to climb to the very summit
But, if you stick with it, it's a climb like no other
It's a reading journey you've never had
And probably will never have again
