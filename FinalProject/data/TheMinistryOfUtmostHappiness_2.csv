TheMinistryOfUtmostHappiness	Arundhati Roy
This is beautifully-written and tightly-plotted, but sort of weird in its politics
It is all about the very seamy side of what is going on in Kashmir--which the author wants to turn into a kind of parable
However all sides in the conflict seem to be distasteful, so she is hard-pressed to find a way for the characters to represent the moral high ground
And the book, for all that's good about it, never gets over that hurdle
