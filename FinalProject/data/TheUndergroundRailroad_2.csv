TheUndergroundRailroad	Colson Whitehead
LOVED THIS
So in full transparency, I was skeptical about it, because as a U
S
history major, I have read so many books about slavery, I just wasn't sure what Whitehead could possibly do that would be fresh, enthralling, unique to the genre and subject matter
Let me tell you something
I was up late, gripping this book, white knuckling it if you will
There were times when I was terribly afraid for the protagonist and my heart was pounding wildly as she faced any number of situations
I would have to put it down, and think, this isn't even real! The thing is, though the premise is imaginary, clearly slavery was not
Being a young black woman, this hit close to home
What if this was me? Would I have been strong enough to stay focused and calculating
Would I have been picked as an ideal partner to escape with? The end is strong, though absolutely infuriating in some aspects
I realize this was done intentionally, as ultimately this isn't Disney so you're not supposed to close with the happily ever after
I'd strongly suggest this novel if you're looking for a powerful read
