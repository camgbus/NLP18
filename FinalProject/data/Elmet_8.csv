The Readers Room, does a Man Booker shadow panel every year (I've participated the last two years) and it's been such a fabulous experience	O
The list this year is very strong	Rev
I've loved almost everything I've read	Rev
"This one was the ""surprise"" of the list"	Rev

This is a story of family loyalty and survival	Sto
I guess because of the main characters loyalty and survival instincts I was endeared to them, which made me root for them which put me in a place of emotional response to everything which happened	Char
I found the writing solid and the storytelling really good	WS
It was transported the whole way through	Rev
It's a little like a Little House in the Big Woods of our time, and there were aspects of it which reminded me of one of my my all time favorite books Into the Forest	Rev

He was a naïve child to be sure, but introspective and to some degree sophisticated	Char
Maybe I'm reading into it	Rev
It's a short, engaging book, and certainly worth a go	Rev
