LincolnInTheBardo	George Saunders
I almost want to break this review into two parts
One for those who know Saunders and one for those who’ll be experiencing him for the first time
What does it matter? Well, you’re about to hear and read a lot about this book, Lincoln in the Bardo, about Saunders himself (there was so much press with Tenth of December that I feel like he and I have hung out multiple times; that I know all his stories), and about his genius
Then, if you’ve never read him, and especially if you haven’t read much in the way of modern or post-modern literature, you’re going to pick up this book and put it down in about five minutes
That, dear readers, would be a grave (see what I did there?) error, a real tragedy
Why? Because Saunders’ much anticipated first novel really is as genius as the stories and interviews and blurbs are going to claim, but you have to do a little more of the work as a reader than you might be used to
Much anticipated is the phrase you’ll probably hear most
What that should tell you is that Saunders has a strong fan base
He truly does, and full disclosure here, I’ve counted myself among them for a few years now
His mastery of the short story is well known, with the use of quirky characters, odd theme parks, and surreal science fiction-y, angst inducing situations known to take you to dark, uncomfortable places but that still manage to find and nourish a spark of humanistic hope
Perhaps the most common feeling among his readers as they’ve enjoyed these works is “man, I wish this guy would write a novel!” He has, and in true Saunders fashion, he’s ensured that very little about the experience is “normal”
I’m not going to regurgitate plot here, plenty of better reviews have already done you that favor
What I do want to make sure to express is the feel of the structure and the experience, perhaps in terms of other things you’ve read and seen
The most common comparison I’ve read is Edgar Lee Masters’ “Spoon River Anthology”
The comparison is apt, there are similarities, mainly in that the dead speak to us of their pasts and especially of their mistakes
But Masters’ dead are much less playful and rarely attempt humor while Saunders’ cast of spirits deliver several laugh out loud moments as they guide readers through the tale
I thought often of Twain as I read
Another comparison that came to mind several times was Dante’s Inferno
Though instead of a proper hell, we are treated to a description of a Bardo, a purgatory where spirits have remained in between their death and their final destination
Each held up for reasons of their own personal obsessions, several of which are brilliantly and humorously described throughout the novel
Others are devastatingly sad yet delivered equally as powerfully
The reader increasingly learns about the rules and behaviors of that Bardo through these snippets of stories
This is probably a good time to talk about structure
It’s quite different and again, I’d expect no less from Saunders
Picture a Greek chorus, a paragraph or two of dialog (rarely more) with an attribution after each
It is startling at first and again, will be especially so to readers less familiar with modern and post-modern lit
And so it is this difference that will probably be the biggest complaint as the reviews begin to pile up here
My advice? Hang in there, it works and it works quite well
In fact, you’ll not only get used to it, you’ll learn to love it
More comparisons now
Lincoln, the titular and in some ways central (though in many ways not) character expresses the most powerful dialog and I often thought of Shakespeare when Lincoln spoke
These are beautiful and profound moments, by far the novel’s most powerful as he reflects on the death of his son Willie
You don’t have to be a parent to feel the impact of his dialog, but it sure didn’t hurt, and I personally haven’t read such raw, sincere and painful cogitation on death and mourning since I read Twain’s “The Death of Jean”
Readers of Paul Hardings’ Enon have also tasted of similar parental agony
In any case, it is through Lincoln’s character that the deepest waters flow
One other comparative thought, especially if you’re hearing all the publicity and thinking of picking up this novel for grandma who loves to read
It’ll also bring to mind at various times Beavis and Butthead, or maybe Hank and Bobby Hill
I don’t mean that as a negative, I really don’t
But I do understand that this is something about Saunders that people either love or hate
At one moment Lincoln may wax eloquent on the spark of life and in the next, you may be reminded for the tenth time or more that one of the spirits has a massive erection
These moments bring me joy and laughter, but I do comprehend that for some others they don’t carry the proper dignity of their normal read
If you are one such, Saunders may not be for you
Most importantly, I’d implore all readers to keep an open mind
If you’re a Saunders fan, you’re going to be strengthened in that fandom
If you’re new to Saunders, but enjoy alternative structures and have a history of adventurous reading, I’m confident you’ll soon count yourself a soldier in his army
However, if you’re one whose reading tends toward the traditional, conservative in structure and clear in its identity, then Lincoln in the Bardo’s narrative structure and its moments of revelry may at first feel like nails on a chalkboard to you
Please, fight through it
The novel's main points could yet become for you sweet susurrations of humanistic glory that leave you wet eyed and wondering where Mr
Saunders has been all your life
