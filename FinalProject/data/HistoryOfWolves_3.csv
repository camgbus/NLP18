HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
History Of Wolves is an intricately told tale of a teenager’s experience of being the outsider and the consequences of naively made decisions made in order to belong
To be honest, even after a few days mulling over this book I’m still not really sure what I think about it and have found this review quite challenging to write
Written in the first person, Linda narrates as a thirty-seven year old reflecting on her life as a teenager, interspersed with glimpses of her life as an adult
There is no clear line of demarcation between these different time points as you see in other books, ie separation through chapters, however it flows well and is not confusing
I rather liked this more complex structure and it is well executed
Linda grew up on an old hippy commune in Minnesota with parents who largely give her free rein
This causes difficulties for her at school as she is marked out as different by the other pupils
I didn’t particularly like Linda, or any of the characters, however this wasn’t a problem for me as I often get as much out of disliking a character in a book as I do those I like
Linda comes across as a voyeur as she comments and observes her fellow pupils, teachers and later her new neighbours who she becomes tied up with
Some of her actions and thoughts are questionable, yet understandable given her upbringing
The pace is slow moving, taking a while in my opinion to get to the main crux of the story
What I initially felt was the main storyline turned out not to be so and this led to my interest in it waxing and waning as I read
When I eventually thought I knew where the story was going it changed again
Linda’s teacher is found guilty of possessing indecent images of children, however the story then becomes dominated by another theme
I still haven’t fully figured out the role this story line played, is it a red herring or have I just failed to see it’s relevance? I don’t want to give too much of the plot away as it came as a surprise to me and I would hate to ruin this for future readers, but the eventual reason for the trial Linda refers to in the beginning relates to a religion and it’s devastating consequences
What eventually occurs is, however, both thought-provoking and shocking
Fridland is great at drip feeding snippets of information that eventually make sense and giving that feeling of something not being right that you just can’t put your finger on
Her use of prose wonderfully sets up the sense of time and place with the cold and barren nature of teenage Linda’s surroundings shining through from the pages
An intriguing book that has certainly stayed with me, causing me to swing between liking it and not really liking it
It is a book that I may re-visit as I get the feeling it is a book that could be enjoyed more the second time around
Read it without the expectation that it will immediately grip you but will take you on a slow-burning journey you won’t forget in a hurry
