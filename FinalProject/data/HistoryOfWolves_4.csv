Raised in a hippy commune which fell apart, Linda is unsure if her parents are actually her real blood kin
Her childhood has been devoid of love, compassion and the closeness she's seen other families naturally displaying for one another
She's a loner at school, referred to with cruel nicknames
Her wardrobe consists of minimal pieces and is shared with her parents
"Her ""room"" is a low loft over her parents' room, accessible by a ladder with a mattress crammed against the rafters"
Linda is now 37 and reflecting on her youth, in particular, events that happened when she was 14
A teacher supposedly abused another lonely quiet girl whom Linda has an unhealthy fixation on
Across the lake from her families' shack, a mother and her 4-year old son move into their new home in the early spring
Again, Linda is strangely attracted and almost stalking them
The young family is members of the Christian Science Church
The father Leo is controlling but often gone for long periods of time, and young son Paul doesn't seem to have the curiosity and energy of a typical 4-year old boy surrounded by nature
As the events of that spring unfold, we begin to see just how unstable Linda is
Her personality has many layers and at no point will you fully understand her
You may have sympathy for why she's the way she is, but you're not quite sure what to expect
This was a very fascinating read; one you have to work a little bit at to unfold
If you prefer books that spoon-feed you, this is not for you
It's dark, full of human angst and emotions, and not the sunniest of endings
I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of reading it, and I don't hesitate to recommend it to others who aren't looking for another Cinderella story
