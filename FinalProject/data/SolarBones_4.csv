"This is a special book which I think may have been a bit hampered by the ""gimmick"" of being a single sentence"
It didn't need the gimmick, it stands on its own
"The structure suited the book perfectly, I think the ""press"" about it just blew it out of proportion"
(Though I listened, I also went through some parts in the print version
) It's a beautiful story of a man reflecting on his simple, complex life
Aside from the structure of the novel, there was nothing particularly original about the story - it was just so deftly told
Reading stream of consciousness writing is not my thing at all so I decided to listen to this one on audio
Part of me wishes I'd read it, but I'm not sure I would have made it through
Aside from that, this was a STELLAR audio
It's one of those books that was made for audio and the narrator was absolutely perfect
I finished 36 hours ago and it's still kicking around in my head
As I think about it in relation to the other Booker short listed books (as much as I loved all of them) I do still feel a bit surprised this didn't make the shortlist
A worthy book I never would have read had it not been for the Man Booker
