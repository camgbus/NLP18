"This is a special book which I think may have been a bit hampered by the ""gimmick"" of being a single sentence"	Rev
It didn't need the gimmick, it stands on its own	Rev
"The structure suited the book perfectly, I think the ""press"" about it just blew it out of proportion"	WS
(Though I listened, I also went through some parts in the print version	Rev
) It's a beautiful story of a man reflecting on his simple, complex life	Sto
Aside from the structure of the novel, there was nothing particularly original about the story - it was just so deftly told	WS
Reading stream of consciousness writing is not my thing at all so I decided to listen to this one on audio	Rev
Part of me wishes I'd read it, but I'm not sure I would have made it through	Rev
Aside from that, this was a STELLAR audio	O
It's one of those books that was made for audio and the narrator was absolutely perfect	O
I finished 36 hours ago and it's still kicking around in my head	Rev
As I think about it in relation to the other Booker short listed books (as much as I loved all of them) I do still feel a bit surprised this didn't make the shortlist	Rev
A worthy book I never would have read had it not been for the Man Booker	Rev
