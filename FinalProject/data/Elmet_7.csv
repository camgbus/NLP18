Elmet	Fiona Mozley
I don't know why, but I began reading this book thinking that it was a suspense novel (and also b/c I figured if it was up for the Man Booker prize, it must be good)	Rev
Perhaps this initial impression steered me wrong	Rev
I spent the first 100 pages of this book (which is only a total of 320 pages long) extraordinarily bored and suffering to get through it	Rev
Mind you, I don't hate reading	Rev
And there are plenty of books that I struggled through several hundred pages to begin, but eventually got engaged in the story and enjoyed it (Infinite Jest comes to mind, for instance)	Rev
But Elmet was not one of those books	Rev
While the prose was clearly selected with care and a mind towards poetic descriptions, I found the storytelling element itself to be lacking	WS
Only half way through the book did the plot just *begin* to form	Rev
And then most of the exciting story was told in the last 70 pages in a rush	WS
And the conclusion of the story was unsatisfying, though probably by design	Sto
"I think that it still could have been done better, especially with regard to the ""present day"" narrative vs the historical narrative"	WS
"I do like how well the author was able to flesh out characters through both descriptions as well as example (""showing"" is stronger than ""telling"")"	Char
Though ultimately you end up with a sharp left turn b/c the figures end up acting completely out of character	Char
(This could be a lesson in our inability to see those close to us for what they are and willful blindness?)	Sto
 And there is almost a magical quality in the time and place the author set the story	Sto
I could have sworn the narrator was operating a century ago, maybe more, b/c of the relationship the children had to nature and the world around them (e.g. carving their own bows and arrows for hunting; building their own house or furniture)	Sum
Through Elmet, you can glean some insights about how to make charcoal or pluck feathers from a bird during food prep--things that made me and the modern world feel far removed from yesteryear	Sum
But then, as I continued reading, I'd be jolted back to present day by the mention of automobiles or even the EuroMillions	Rev
The greatest problem I have about the story is the anticlimatic approach to the primary conflicts I could identify, one internal for the narrator and the other an external conflict with the landlord	Sto
Both conflicts are inadequately fleshed out or detailed	Rev
And with regards to the landlord, brought to abrupt climax and conclusion immediately after the other	Sum
My final word on this book is that it is an excellent short story--unnecessarily and clumsily stretched into a novel just for the sake of turning it into a novel	Rev
