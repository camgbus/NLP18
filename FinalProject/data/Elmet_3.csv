It took a while to really get into his book
I think it was because of the immediate lengthy and superfluous writing
The author elaborated in prose on the most inconsequential details that I found it hard to concentrate
almost as though she were writing a book of poetry rather than a novel
It wasn’t until I’d forced myself to continue reading and was able to figure out the characters and the story, that I realized she possibly did this because the main character had been so isolated and removed from society at such a young age, that he would indeed think and observe in such a way as to notice detail to a degree in which the average person would not
Once invested in the book, I found myself hooked
Imagine my dismay when the end of the book had not even a hint of closure
I enjoy books with some room for interpretation in regards to the ending but this was as if the writer grew bored with the story and just stopped
Nothing to suggest what could have happened in any way
“Boy is watching people in the city
looking at stranger’s faces, blah blah
The end
” Well, thanks a lot for that load of crap
Otherwise, it’s well written and I found the story fascinating
