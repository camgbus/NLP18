Wow
This book
Do yourself a favor and clear your schedule for 24 hours, find your favorite reading perch, and arrange for someone to walk the dogs…because once you start, you’re not coming up for air
Madeline Furston is fascinated by the study of wolves and no wonder
At 14 years old, she is living in a failed commune with a father who is “kind to objects” and a mother who means well but hasn’t quite mastered her nurturing instincts
An outcast in her north Minnesota school with a keen sense of woodland survival instincts, she tries to make sense of the world – particularly a possible tryst between her history teacher and the class beauty, Lily
When Patra – a 20-something-year-old mother – and her toddler son Paul move nearby, Madeline seizes the chance to become involved
She renames herself Linda and becomes an unofficial governess
But something is not quite right with the scenario
Little hints are dropped that could easily fly by (for instance, why is the 4-year-old still wearing a diaper?) but Linda does not have the social skills to decipher what is going on
And when Patra’s controlling and charismatic husband, Leo, arrives, tension really begins to build and yet it’s unclear as to why
This debut book succeeds on so many levels
The questions at its core are: What’s the difference between what you want to believe and what you do? And what’s the difference between what you think and what you end up doing? At our hearts, are we all children? (Emily Fridlund writes, “By their nature, it seems to me, children were freaks
They believed impossible things to suit themselves, thought their fantasies were the center of the world
They were the best kinds of quacks, if that’s what you wanted – pretenders who didn’t know they were pretending at all
” What happens when our beliefs become so powerful that we become, without intention, freaks? There are many ways that these themes circle and enfold upon each other and to get into that too deeply would be to create spoilers
I will say this: Emily Fridlund is a true master at ratcheting up tension, creating a compelling atmosphere, staying in control of her themes, and ultimately, unraveling what it means to be a misunderstood predator-of-sorts
The writing is downright gorgeous
This is the real deal
5 strong stars
