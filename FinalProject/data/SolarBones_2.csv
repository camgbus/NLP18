SolarBones	Mike McCormack
Marcus Conway is an engineer living in a rural seaside community in northwestern Ireland
The book is a nonlinear account of his life
We learn about his growing up, his marriage, his family- including his two children and his wife
We learn about his job and his friends
It is not a particularly interesting life, yet, his narrative is compelling
The ending seems to come out of nowhere â€“ which is probably the point- and packs an emotional wallop
SOLAR BONES is long listed for the prestigious Man Booker Award
For this reason it will receive a lot of attention
The book is quite unique in that it is written without a beginning of a sentence and ends in the middle of a sentence
No periods
This might appear strange and quite daunting
It might appear to be experimental and would only appeal to a certain type of reader looking to invest a lot of work and intellectual energy into the reading experience
However, I am happy to report that this is not the case at all
The narrative flows
It is compelling
There is a lot of truth in what the author writes and the reader can identify with the character in every episode described
This is not to say that a reader starved for intellectual discourse will not find it here
It can be read on multiple levels
The book is not long and can be read in a couple of sittings
I look for uniqueness in a book and this one has that hands down
Highly recommended
