SolarBones	Mike McCormack
Marcus Conway is an engineer living in a rural seaside community in northwestern Ireland	Sum
The book is a nonlinear account of his life	Sum
We learn about his growing up, his marriage, his family- including his two children and his wife	Sum
We learn about his job and his friends	Sum
It is not a particularly interesting life, yet, his narrative is compelling	Sum
The ending seems to come out of nowhere â€“ which is probably the point- and packs an emotional wallop	Sum
SOLAR BONES is long listed for the prestigious Man Booker Award	O
For this reason it will receive a lot of attention	O
The book is quite unique in that it is written without a beginning of a sentence and ends in the middle of a sentence	WS
No periods	WS
This might appear strange and quite daunting	WS
It might appear to be experimental and would only appeal to a certain type of reader looking to invest a lot of work and intellectual energy into the reading experience	WS
However, I am happy to report that this is not the case at all	Rev
The narrative flows	WS
It is compelling	WS
There is a lot of truth in what the author writes and the reader can identify with the character in every episode described	Char
This is not to say that a reader starved for intellectual discourse will not find it here	Sto
It can be read on multiple levels	Sto
The book is not long and can be read in a couple of sittings	WS
I look for uniqueness in a book and this one has that hands down	Rev
Highly recommended	Rev
