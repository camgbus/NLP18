DaysWithoutEnd 	Sebastian Barry	
This novel is so beautifully written	Writing Style	
It is like one enormous poem	Writing Style	
The events recounted- the Civil War and the murder of the American Indian - are horrific	Story	
But there is hope and love and the hope of love residing in the hearts of the main characters	Story	Characterization
Painful, moving- the best book I have read in a long while	Story
