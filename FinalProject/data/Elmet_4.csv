I absolutely love the writing style, characters, and the story
Another reviewer mentioned the voice of the main character didn't seem to fit how the character would have spoken in real life
This may be, but it was not a problem for me
I saw the narrator as looking back in time, looking back from a place of more maturity and experience
I could not put this book down
I would love to read more from this author
This is the type of writing where I would reread phrases or sentences because they were so beautiful to me
