This is an excellent book, combining lyricism, a clear expression of a clearly imagined life, a propulsive concern for fundamental values that both shine through the text and elude pat description, and deeply satisfying storytelling
For me, the unusual grammar and syntax quickly became transparent, justified by a physical momentum that carried the story through the brilliant sequences of arresting images, linked meditations and everyday events that are at the heart of this book
Mike McCormack is doing something wondrous hereâ€”diving into a specific story with a passion and craft that connects it to larger events and not flinching from the enormous imaginative task of granting himself the free hand needed to create his own rhythm and particular language; a precise embodiment of the experience his story requires
This book is a breathtaking example of how a courageous and skilled writer can work real magic
