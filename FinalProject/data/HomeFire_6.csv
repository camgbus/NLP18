HomeFire	Kamila Shamsie
I finished 'Home Fire' a few hours ago and I'm still stuck in my head, thinking about it
It is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read
This from a 48 year old who has been a voracious reader since childhood, which hopefully says something
Others are better at describing what happens in the book but just know that the book demonstrates that the political is deeply personal
I felt for all the characters, could understand the choices they made whether I agreed with them or not
