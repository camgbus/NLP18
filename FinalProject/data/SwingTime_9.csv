SwingTime	Zadie Smith
Every character is very fully developed	Char
Smith shows you exactly who these people are, and enforces it every time	Char
I love that the main character - who is never given a name, is the only one who is stuck, unable to choose a direction and GO, while everyone else's lives change around her	Char
It's a long book, and it takes a while to finish, but it's masterfully written	WS
I'm still thinking about it two weeks later	Rev
