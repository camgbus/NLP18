The writing of this novel straddles a line between poetry and prose
It reads well
At moments, too, it borders on the expression of profound insights
What I found most interesting was its simultaneous grasp of the particular and the cosmic
The narrator gives a meandering account of his own life, and yet you get the sense that in its outlines and in its suggestion of the dimensions of human experience it also tells the story of every life
Perhaps it was my mood, though, or the fact I've been busy of late, but I found it didn't keep my attention
I'd read a few pages at a sitting, and it took me a long time to get through it
I found moments that stood out and surprised me with their insight or their raw and gripping description
There were other long passages, describing details of the narrators life, that I found it difficult to care about or connect to the overall vision
I couldn't always see the rationale for what was included and left out, since it really isn't a plot driven piece
I might go back to it sometime later
It strikes me as worth it, but it is a bit of work to get through
