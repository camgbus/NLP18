HistoryOfWolves	Emily Fridlund
If ever there was a book that was meant for a winter day, it is Emily Fridlund’s brilliant novel THE HISTORY OF WOLVES
There is so much going on in this book – eerily taking you to places you don’t necessarily want to go, yet you are drawn from the beginning
It is hard to describe in one word what it is about
There are taboo subjects – children who are taken advantage of by adults, children who are neglected by their parents, teens who are left to their own devices, and just plain, old mean girls
Our protagonist leads us on a path, sometimes contently paddling over the lake waters, quietly trying to sleep as an outsider in her own home, in the high school bathroom stall listening to the familiar teasing of classmates, trying to wedge herself in to another family that from the outside looks ideal, or by a language only she knows through her dogs, which seem like the only true relationship that is both comforting and easy, but she really wants us to follow her train of thought, perhaps to help her find her way
Yet, there are lessons learned out in the deep woods of Minnesota
Often you think that only these sort of lessons come from books or teachers, or wise people such as jaded folks who live in the city
Following the fast pace of alert-in-her-own-way teen Madeline’s well-grounded footsteps, we see her world through the woods
She is a loner who wants to belong, desperately clinging to any branch that sways, hanging on to those that might seem to be a fit
An eerily, quiet, and disturbing tale, that will leave you wondering
