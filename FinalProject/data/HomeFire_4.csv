When I turned the last page of the book I was struck dumb	Rev
I didn’t expect the ending, and I highly recommend that no one attempt to read the ending before they begin	Rev
Don’t peek, I implore you!	Rev
Most likely, the reader will bounce back and forth, for and against each idea as the story unfolds	Rev
When it begins, the reader meets Isma Pasha, the caregiver of her twin siblings, Aneeka and Parvaiz; she is living in England	Sum
She is thoughtful and reserved, observes the ritual of prayer, though not five times a day, and wears a hijab, but is not extreme in her views	Sum
She is careful about how she expresses herself because of her father’s past	Sum
He was a known jihadist	Sum
When her twin siblings were orphaned, at age 12, she, almost 19, put her life on hold and stepped in to care for them	Sum
Now that they are 19, she would like to continue living her own life	Sum
When she is given the opportunity, by a former teacher, Dr Hira Shah, to study at Amherst University, in Massachusetts, she grabs it	Sum
There she meets Eamonn, the son of the Home Secretary in England, Karamat Lone	Sum
She becomes enamored with Eamonn, but it is unrequited love because Eamonn considers himself like her brother	Sum
However, he does become interested in her sister after seeing her photo	Sum
Aneeka is beautiful	Sum
When Isma made her decision to leave Wembley for America, it portended great changes for the twins, but they seemed to take the news well, with Parvaiz showing a bit more concern about it	Sum
He did not want to move out of his home to live with his Aunty Naseem	Sum
Feeling more abandoned than his sister, who can already taste the greater freedom she will have, his personality begins to change	Sum
He becomes more secretive and reticent	Sum
He meets and becomes completely entranced by Farook who becomes a father figure of sorts as he twists Parvaiz’s mind into thinking that he too should leave Wembley, but not for the purpose of study like his sister	Sum
When Farook tells him that men should be in charge of women, Parvaiz likes the idea	Sum
He believes his life is suddenly coming apart due to the actions of his sisters	Sum
He is an innocent who is unsuccessful academically, under employed and very naïve; when Farook lionizes Adil Pasha, Parvaiz’s father, for his jihadism, he is easily seduced	Sum
Farook convinces him to leave England for Syria and to join him in his fight for the Caliphate	Sum
Aneeka wears a hijab and prays, is a free spirit and much more outgoing and modern than her quieter, modest sister	Sum
She seems quick to judge and is impulsive, expecting to get her way because of her beauty	Sum
When she learns that her sister has betrayed her brother, reporting him to the authorities, they become estranged	Sum
She becomes very involved with the same Eamonn her sister knew	Sum
Does she have an ulterior motive, or is it a true made in heaven romance?	Sum
As a twin, I can relate to the special bond that exists, the special loyalty that embraces the siblings	Rev
Twins have a unique connection and the absence of one often makes the remaining one feel incomplete	O
I can identify with Aneeka’s unconditional devotion to Parvaiz	Rev
